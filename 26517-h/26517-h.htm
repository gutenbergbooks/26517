<h2>FINDING THE NEW HOME</h2>
</div>

<p>The late afternoon sunshine sent its
slanting, golden rays through the car
windows on to the map that Mary Jane and
her sister Alice had spread out on the table
between the seats of the Pullman in which
they were riding.</p>
<p>&#8220;And all that wiggly line is water?&#8221; Mary
Jane was asking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every bit water,&#8221; replied their father,
who bent over their heads to explain what
they were looking at; &#8220;a lot of water, you
see. You remember I told you that Chicago
is right on the edge of Lake Michigan. And
Lake Michigan, so far as looks are concerned,
might just as well be the ocean you saw down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
in Florida&mdash;it&#8217;s so big you can&#8217;t see the other
side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And does it have big waves?&#8221; asked
Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just you wait and see,&#8221; promised Mr.
Merrill. &#8220;Big waves! I should say it
has!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And all the green part of the map is
parks,&#8221; said Alice, quoting what her father
had told them when he first showed them the
map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there must be a lot of parks,&#8221; suggested
Mary Jane with interest. &#8220;I think
I&#8217;d like to live by a park,&#8221; she added
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I should too,&#8221; agreed Mr. Merrill,
&#8220;and it&#8217;s near a park we will make the
first hunt for a home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; cried Mary Jane suddenly as
she glanced up from the spread-out map;
&#8220;what&#8217;s that, Dadah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the beginning of Chicago,&#8221; said
Mr. Merrill. &#8220;Let&#8217;s fold up the map now
and see what we can of the city. This is
South Chicago; and those great stacks and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
flaming chimneys are steel mills and foundries
and factories&mdash;watch now! There are
more!&#8221;</p>
<p>The train on which the Merrill family
were traveling went dashing past factory
after factory&mdash;past an occasional open
space where they could see in the distance
the blue gleam of Lake Michigan and past
great wide stretches where tracks and more
tracks on which freight cars and engines sped
up and down showed them something of
the whirling industry that has made South
Chicago famous. No wonder it was a
strange sight to the two girls&mdash;they had
never before seen anything that made them
even guess the big business that they now
saw spread out before them.</p>
<p>They had spent all their lives thus far&mdash;Alice
was twelve and Mary Jane going on
six&mdash;in a small city of the Middle West and
though they had had a fine summer in the
country visiting grandma and grandpa and
had only the winter before taken a beautiful
trip through Florida, they had never been to
a great city. And now they were not going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
to visit or to take a trip. They were going
to live there. The great big city of
Chicago was to be their home.</p>
<p>The pretty little house they had loved so
well was sold. The furniture and books
and dolls and clothes were all packed and
loaded on a freight car to follow them to
the city and all the dear friends had been
given a farewell. Mary Jane had loved the
excitement and muss of packing; the great
boxes and the masses of crinkly excelsior
and the workmen around who always had
time for a pleasant joke with an interested
little girl. But when it came time to say
good-by to Doris and to her much loved
kindergarten and to all the boys and girls
in school and &#8220;on her block,&#8221; going away
wasn&#8217;t so funny. In fact, Mary Jane felt
a queer and troublesome lump in her throat
most of the morning when the good-bys were
said.</p>
<p>But the ride on the train (and how Mary
Jane did love to ride on the train); and the
nice luncheon on the diner (and how Mary
Jane did <i>adore</i> eating on a diner&mdash;hashed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
brown potatoes, a whole order by herself and
ice cream and everything!); and then father&#8217;s
nice talk about all the fun they were
going to have, made the lump vanish and in
its place there developed an eager desire to
see the new city and to begin all the promised
fun. It was then that Mr. Merrill
showed them the big map of the city and
pointed out the part of the city where they
would likely live.</p>
<p>As the girls watched, the great factories
and foundries slipped away into the distance,
and in their place the girls could see
houses and occasional stores and here and
there a station, past which their train
dashed as though it wasn&#8217;t looking for stations
to-day, thank you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t we stop anywhere?&#8221; asked Mary
Jane after she had counted three of these
little stations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are suburban stations,&#8221; explained
Mr. Merrill, &#8220;and a big through train like
ours hasn&#8217;t time to stop at every one.
Pretty soon another train will come along
and stop at each one of those we are now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
passing so don&#8217;t you worry about folks getting
left. <i>This</i> train we are on has got to
get us into Chicago in time for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just at that minute, when the big
three story apartment buildings that looked
so very queer and strange to Mary Jane,
began to fill every block, the porter came
to brush her off and to help her on with her
coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to live here in Chicago,&#8221; she
said to him as he held the coat for her, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s a big place with lots of lake and
parks and&mdash;houses, I guess, and most everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed it is big, missy,&#8221; replied the
porter, &#8220;and I hope you&#8217;s going to like it
a lot, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-going to,&#8221; answered Mary Jane
confidently, as she picked up Georgiannamore
and Georgiannamore&#8217;s suit case which
at the last moment couldn&#8217;t possibly be
packed in the trunk, and followed her
father and mother down the aisle, &#8220;&#8217;cause
mother and Dadah and Alice are going to
live here too and we always have fun.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Merrill had decided to get
off at one of the larger suburban stations
and spend a few days in a near-by hotel; they
thought the comparative quiet of a residence
hotel would be better for their girls than
the flurry and hurry of a big down town
hotel. But to Mary Jane, accustomed to
the sights and sounds of a small city where
street cars went dignifiedly past every
fifteen minutes and where traffic &#8220;cops&#8221;
would have very few duties, the confusion
she found herself in was quite enough
to be very interesting.</p>
<p>They stepped off the train, walked down
some stairs and found themselves on the
sidewalk of a very busy street. Overhead
the noise of their own train rumbling cityward
made a terrific din; and as though that
were not enough, still higher up the great
elevated car line made a rumble and roar.
Mary Jane craned her neck as they walked
from under the trains and there high in the
air, she saw street cars running along as
though street cars always had and always
would, run on tracks high up in the air!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Can we ride on it, Dadah?&#8221; she shouted
to her father, &#8220;are we going to ride on that
train up on stilts?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Merrill shook his head laughingly and
hurried them into a waiting taxi.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to ride there to-day,&#8221;
he explained when the door of the car shut
out some of the noise, &#8220;but some day soon
we&#8217;ll take a long ride on the elevated and
then you can see all the back yards and back
porches and parks and streets and everything
about the city, just as plain as plain
can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he was talking, the Merrills drove
through streets lined on both sides with
three-story apartment buildings. But before
Mary Jane had time to ask a question or
even think what she would like to say, they
whisked around a corner and out into the
beautiful wide driveway on the Midway&mdash;the
long, green parkway that stretched, or
so it seemed to Mary Jane, for miles in both
directions. The taxi pulled up in front of a
comfortable looking hotel right on the side
of the park and Mary Jane wasn&#8217;t a bit sorry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
to get out and take a breath of fresh air and
look at the lovely view before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now just as soon as you are washed up,&#8221;
said Mrs. Merrill, briskly, as they went into
the hotel, &#8220;you and Alice may come out onto
this nice porch and watch the children play
on the Midway and get a little run before
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may be sure that with that promise
before her, Mary Jane didn&#8217;t take very long
to primp. She had spied a group of children
about her age, who seemed to be having a
beautiful time playing ball out there on the
grass and she couldn&#8217;t help noticing that
they played just as she and Doris did and
she couldn&#8217;t help wishing that she too, even
though she was a new little girl just come
to town, could play with them. So she
stood very still while Mrs. Merrill tied the
fresh hair bow and slipped on a clean frock
and then, holding tight to big sister Alice&#8217;s
friendly hand she went down the one flight
of stairs&mdash;she was in far too big a hurry to
wait for the elevator&mdash;and out onto the
long roomy porch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>Just across the narrow street in front of
the hotel and on the nearest bit of parkway,
three little girls about Mary Jane&#8217;s age were
still playing ball. One was dainty and
small and had yellow curls; one was rather
tall and had long straight dark hair and the
third had dark, straight hair bobbed short,
and snapping black eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be funny,&#8221; said Mary Jane
as she looked at them wistfully, &#8220;if I&#8217;d get
to know those girls and they&#8217;d be friends.
If I <i>did</i>,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I think she&#8217;d be my
mostest friend,&#8221; and Mary Jane pointed to
the little girl with the dark, bobbed hair.</p>
<p>While they watched and were trying to
get up courage to go over and play too, a
pretty girl about Alice&#8217;s age came along the
street. Her hair was copper colored and
curly and very, very pretty. And her smile
when she saw the little girls who were playing,
made her seem so friendly and
&#8220;homey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been hunting you, Betty,&#8221; she said
to the little girl Mary Jane liked best. &#8220;It&#8217;s
time to come home for dinner.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>So the four girls, three little folks and
one bigger one, went around the corner toward
home, and two strangers, standing on
the porch, watched them till they were quite
out of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be funny,&#8221; said Alice, &#8220;if
we&#8217;d ever get to know them. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d
like to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it though!&#8221; exclaimed Mary
Jane. &#8220;I hope we do!&#8221;</p>
<p>And all the time they were eating their
first dinner in Chicago, and telling mother
and father about the children they had seen
and making plans about what to do to-morrow,
they were thinking about those two
girls and wishing to know them better.</p>
<p>Little did they guess what would really
truly happen before the week was over!</p>

<h2>THE FOLKS AROUND THE CORNER</h2>
</div>

<p>Three whole days of flat hunting!
And of all the fun she had ever had
in her more than five years of life, Mary
Jane thought flat hunting in Chicago was
the most fun of all! She loved the mystery
of each new apartment; the guessing
which room might be hers and which mother&#8217;s;
the hunting up the door bell and hearing
its sound (for as you very well know
each door bell has a sound of its own); the
poking into closets and pantries and porches.
It was the most delightful sort of exploring
she had ever come across and she couldn&#8217;t
at all understand why mother and father
got tired and somewhat discouraged. For
<i>her</i> part Mary Jane was tempted to wish
that they would never find a flat, well hardly
that; but that finding the right one would
take a long, oh, a very long time!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>But by the afternoon of the third day, her
legs began to get a little tired too, and her
eyes looked more often to the green of the
Midway they occasionally saw and she
thought that flats, even empty flats, really
should have chairs for folks to sit on. So,
as a matter of fact, she wasn&#8217;t half as sorry
as she had thought she would be, when, on
the afternoon of the third day of hunting
the Merrill family came across a charming
little apartment.</p>
<p>It was on the second floor of a very attractive
red brick building; it had five rooms,
quite too small, father thought, but then one
can&#8217;t have everything, they had found, and
every room was light and sunny and cheerful.
But the part about it that Mary Jane
and Alice liked the best was the back porch.
To be sure there was a front porch, a pretty,
little porch with a stone railing and a view
way down the street toward the park and
lake. But off the dining room the girls discovered
a small balcony that overlooked the
back yard next door, a back yard that had
a garden laid out and a chicken house and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
everything so homey and comfortable looking
that the girls immediately wanted to sit
out and watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if we&#8217;d stay here maybe some
children would come out to play,&#8221; suggested
Mary Jane in a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they would, too,&#8221; agreed Alice.
&#8220;And I think if we lived here maybe we
could get acquainted and play with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s live here!&#8221; exclaimed Mary Jane
and she ran back into the house just at the
very minute Mr. and Mrs. Merrill decided
to rent the apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you think you&#8217;ll like it, do you?&#8221; said
Mrs. Merrill, smiling; &#8220;the rooms are pretty
small.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we&#8217;ll love it,&#8221; said Alice eagerly,
&#8220;and you should see the back porch.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mr. Merrill laughed when they
showed him the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you call this a porch,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;why it&#8217;s not half big enough for a porch!
I&#8217;d call it a balcony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;and then
when you watch folks in the yard down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
there,&mdash;for you <i>are</i> planning to watch and
get acquainted, aren&#8217;t you?&mdash;then you can
pretend that this is your balcony seat and
that the folks down there are in a play for
you&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t that be fun?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls thought it would, but there was
so much to plan and think about that they
didn&#8217;t stay on their little balcony any longer
just then, which was something of a pity, for
right after they went indoors, somebody
came out into the yard&mdash; But then, there&#8217;s
no use telling about <i>her</i> for Mary Jane
didn&#8217;t see her.</p>
<p>So Mary Jane and Alice went with their
father and mother into the room that was
to be theirs and they planned just where
each bed should be and where was the best
place for the desk and dressing table and
who should have which side of the closet.
And by that time, it was nearly six o&#8217;clock&mdash;time
to go back to the hotel for dinner.</p>
<p>Mr. Merrill stopped at the desk for mail
as they went up to their room and there he
found a message telling him that their furniture
had arrived in Chicago and that it must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
be taken out of the freight house the next
morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Merrill with
a gasp of dismay, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good thing
we found that flat! What ever would we
have done if we hadn&#8217;t! Well, girls, I
think we&#8217;d better eat a good dinner and then
go to bed early for we&#8217;ll have to get down
there and clean up the flat while father tends
to getting our things delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>So bright and early the next morning
everybody started to work. Mr. Merrill
went down town to meet the moving men
he had engaged by &#8217;phone and Mrs. Merrill
and the two girls put aprons and cleaning
rags and soap, all of which they had brought
in their small trunk, into a little grip and
went down to the new home.</p>
<p>Mary Jane had lots of fun that morning.
First she went down to the basement and
borrowed a broom from the janitor. Then
she went back for clean papers which she
folded neatly and spread on the pantry
shelves which Mrs. Merrill with the good
help of the janitor&#8217;s wife had cleaned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
and ready. Then she put papers on the
shelf of the closet she and Alice were to
share and papers in the drawers near the floor
of that same closet. By that time&mdash;it takes
pretty long to fold papers neatly and get
every bit of the shelf covered, you know&mdash;the
door bell rang&mdash;a great, long, hard ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Can you go, Mary Jane?&#8221;
exclaimed Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;Alice and I both
have wet hands!&#8221; You see, Alice had been
washing mirrors that were on the closet doors
while her mother and the janitor&#8217;s wife did
windows and wood work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m dry,&#8221; said Mary Jane, &#8220;and my
papers are done and I&#8217;d like to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>To tell the honest truth, Mary Jane had
just that very minute been wishing the door
bell would ring. For the janitor&#8217;s wife had
showed her how to press the buzzer that
would release the lock of the front door and
let a person come up the stairs. And of
course Mary Jane wanted to try it. So she
hurried over to the house &#8217;phone, took down
the receiver and said, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; just as
any grown-up person would.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your things!&#8221; said a gruff voice,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll bring &#8217;em up the back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane didn&#8217;t stop to press any buzzer.
She dashed over to the window nearest
the alley and there, sure enough, was a
great big moving van and it was piled up
full of boxes and barrels and crates&mdash;all
the things that Mary Jane had watched the
packing of only such a few days before.
Talk about fun! Moving was surely the
best sport ever!</p>
<p>Mary Jane stayed at the window watching
till the men brought the first load up.
Then they announced that they were going
for lunch and Mrs. Merrill said she and the
girls had better eat while the men were away.
So hastily putting on wraps, they went over
to a small tea room only a few doors away,
where they had a tasty little luncheon so
quickly served that they easily got back to
their flat before the moving men arrived
again.</p>
<p>How that afternoon went, Mary Jane
never quite remembered. It was one long
succession of excitement and fun. The unpacking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
of boxes and crates, the piling up of
rubbish, the finding of cherished belongings
and putting them where they belonged in the
new home, and the gradual change of the
living room from a mess of boxes to a place
that might some day really look like home,
all seemed thrillingly interesting to a little
girl who had never moved before.</p>
<p>But by half past four or thereabouts, even
Mary Jane began to get a little tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you something to do,&#8221; suggested
Mrs. Merrill, when a pause in her own work
gave her a chance to notice that Mary Jane
was getting flushed and tired. &#8220;Here is a
box of doll things I have just come across.
Suppose you take them out into your own
little balcony and sort them over. Put in
this box (and she handed her a little box)
all the things you must surely have upstairs;
and leave in the big box all the things you
will be willing to put in the store room.
Now take your time, dear, and sit down
while you work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane was very glad for that advice.
For even though moving men are wonderful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
to watch, and even though rubbish and boxes
and barrels are all very fascinating, a person
<i>does</i> get tired and sitting down isn&#8217;t at
all a bad idea.</p>
<p>One of the men who was unpacking gave
her her own little chair that he had just uncrated
and so she sat down in state, in her
own chair, on her own balcony and opened
the box of doll things. But that&#8217;s every bit
that got done to those doll things that day,
every bit.</p>
<p>For at that very minute, who should come
out of the house around the corner, the house
with the back yard and garden and chickens
and everything, but&mdash;yes, you must have
guessed it&mdash;the same two girls that Alice and
Mary Jane had seen on the Midway the day
they arrived in Chicago. Think of that!
Right under Mary Jane&#8217;s own balcony and,
moreover, it was plain to see that they lived
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I guess we&#8217;ll get to know them,&#8221;
whispered Mary Jane to herself happily.
But of course, she didn&#8217;t say a thing out
loud. She only sat very still and watched.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>And as she watched, two boys came out
on the back porch of the house around the
corner and one of the boys called, &#8220;Say,
Fran, did you feed the chickens?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl who was about Alice&#8217;s age answered
back, &#8220;No I didn&#8217;t, Ed, I thought it
was Betty&#8217;s turn to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know a lot,&#8221; Mary Jane whispered
to herself. &#8220;She&#8217;s Frances, I&#8217;m sure,
and he&#8217;s Ed; and Betty must be the little
girl that&#8217;s &#8217;bout as big as me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then, when Mary Jane was wishing
and wishing and wishing that she would
come, Alice came to the door of the balcony
and looked out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-h-h!&#8221; whispered Mary Jane, tensely,
&#8220;they&#8217;re here, both of &#8217;em, and there&#8217;s more
of &#8217;em, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice seemed to understand exactly what
Mary Jane meant, even though her sentence
was decidedly mixed up, and she stepped out
onto the balcony.</p>
<p>Frances heard the door shut and looked
up. For a long minute the two girls looked
at each other, then Frances, the girl with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
the auburn hair and the friendly smile,
nodded shyly.</p>
<p>Little Betty didn&#8217;t take long deciding
what she would do. She called eagerly,
&#8220;Moving in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we are,&#8221; laughed Alice, waving her
hand toward the piles of boxes and rubbish
stacked up on the back stairs of the building.</p>
<p>Ed, who had started back into the house,
looked around and, seeing his sisters had
made a small start toward conversation,
called a question on his own responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to use &#8217;em all?&#8221; he asked, pointing
to the boxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, I guess not,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how we could!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then will you give me a box?&#8221; he asked,
running back in the yard till he stood right
under the balcony. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to get
some rabbits, John and I are, and we want a
box for their home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on over and see which one you
want,&#8221; suggested Alice, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll ask father.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>Ed and his brother John lost no time
climbing over the fence and inspecting the
boxes. By the time Alice brought Mr. Merrill,
he had picked out just the one he wanted
and was very grateful when it was given him
for his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to come over and see &#8217;em
make the rabbit house?&#8221; suggested Frances
shyly. &#8220;Oh, maybe you&#8217;re busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we can come,&#8221; replied Alice,
&#8220;because mother just told me she wished
we&#8217;d get some fresh air.&#8221; So Alice and
Mary Jane followed the others to the back yard
and helped hold nails and boards and make
the rabbit house. When it was nearly finished
the children&#8217;s mother, who proved to
be very charming Mrs. Holden, came out
with a plate of cookies and a welcome for
the two little strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the cookies,&#8221; said Mary
Jane politely, &#8220;but we&#8217;re not strange&mdash;that
is, not any more, we aren&#8217;t, we know each
other&mdash;all of us do!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it really seemed to all the children.
They were friends from the first day and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
making the rabbit house was just the beginning
of many nice times in that friendly back
yard.</p>

<h2>VISITING WITH BETTY</h2>
</div>

<p>Three days of hard work for everybody
and then the little flat into which
the Merrills had moved began to look like
a real home. The unpacking was all done
and the rubbish cleared away; the furniture
was polished and set in place; the closets
were in order and every cupboard and shelf
held just the right things for comfort. It
wasn&#8217;t such an easy matter to stow away all
the things the Merrills had used in their
pretty house&mdash;the five room apartment was
much smaller than the house of course&mdash;but
with everybody&#8217;s help the job was done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill, happily,
in the late afternoon of the third day, &#8220;if
you&#8217;ll run the rods in these curtains, Mary
Jane, I&#8217;ll hang them up where they belong
and then we&#8217;ll all three go to market and
then&mdash;guess what? We&#8217;ll have dinner in
our own new home!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>Mary Jane thought that would be fun,
for, much as she loved eating in the hotel
where they had been living while getting
the new home fixed, she liked better to eat
her mother&#8217;s cooking. So it was a very
happy little girl who slipped the rods into
the living room curtains and then put on her
hat and hunted up the market basket from
the pantry.</p>
<p>Now many times before this, Mary Jane
had been marketing with her mother. But
never had she been to such a market! Before,
marketing meant going to the grocery
store about three blocks from their home; it
meant talking to the very interested and
friendly grocer who had known Mary Jane
ever since she first appeared at the grocery
in her big, well-covered cab&mdash;she was then
about two months old; it meant telling Mr.
Shover, the grocer, just what they wanted
and picking out the sorts of things they liked
best. But marketing in Chicago was
very different. In the first place there
wasn&#8217;t a person around they had ever seen
before; and then everything was so big and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
there was so much food. Mary Jane
thought there couldn&#8217;t possibly be enough
folks in Chicago to eat all those good things!
But when she and her mother actually got
into the store and began to buy, Mary Jane
forgot all about the strangeness and remembered
only the fun. For they didn&#8217;t get
somebody to wait on them as they used to
at Mr. Shover&#8217;s&mdash;not at all! They waited
on themselves! They went through a little
turnstile and then wandered around
among the good things all by themselves and
they took down from the well-stocked
shelves anything they wanted. It certainly
was queer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we just take <i>anything</i>?&#8221; exclaimed
Mary Jane in amazement as her mother
explained what they were to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;you must
remember we have to pay for things just the
same as we used to at Mr. Shover&#8217;s. But we
can take anything we want&mdash;if we pay for
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll pick you out some good things
to eat, mother!&#8221; cried Mary Jane happily,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
&#8220;don&#8217;t you worry about thinking what we&#8217;re
going to have!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Mary Jane really did know how to
read, at least a little, but she didn&#8217;t stop
to read on this important occasion. She
looked at the pictures on the cans of goodies
and she picked out a can of all her favorites
and set them in the basket Mrs. Merrill
carried on her arm. But that didn&#8217;t
work, for Mrs. Merrill had a long list and
the basket wouldn&#8217;t hold only so much. So
they decided to let Mrs. Merrill pick out
three things from her list and then Mary
Jane could buy one favorite; then three
more things from the list and then another
favorite. That proved to be great fun and
it certainly did fill the basket in a hurry!
Mary Jane was just trying to decide between
a box of marshmallows and a pan of nice,
gooey, sugary sweet rolls when Mrs. Merrill
said, &#8220;whichever you decide, Mary Jane,
you&#8217;ll have to carry the bundle yourself, because
this basket won&#8217;t hold another parcel&mdash;not
even a little one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane decided on the rolls and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
took them over to the counter to have them
wrapped up and there she almost bumped
into&mdash;Betty Holden, no less! Betty and
her mother were shopping too, and their basket
was almost as full as Mrs. Merrill&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;We market after school,&#8221; said Mrs.
Holden, &#8220;and then Ed brings his wagon to
meet us and hauls the stuff home. We&#8217;ll
get him to give you a lift too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then can Mary Jane come over to
our house to play?&#8221; asked Betty.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a little while,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Merrill,
smilingly, &#8220;but she won&#8217;t want to stay very
long to-day because we&#8217;re going to have our
first dinner in our new home and she&#8217;s promised
to help me lots&mdash;and I need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then they spied Ed&#8217;s face at the door
so they hurried through the second turnstile,
paid for their groceries and left the store.
Ed&#8217;s wagon proved to be very big and he
was glad to give them plenty of room for
the Merrill basket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to start in school to-morrow?&#8221;
asked Betty as they walked off toward
home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to see about that to-morrow
morning,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
been so busy unpacking and settling that we
haven&#8217;t even thought about it till now. Do
you like your school, Betty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do, lots!&#8221; exclaimed Betty heartily.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just through kindergarten this
spring, I am, and next fall I&#8217;m first year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think you must be just about
where Mary Jane will be,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill.</p>
<p>The two little girls ran skipping ahead,
talking about what they would do and where
they would sit and all the things that girls
plan for school.</p>
<p>But when Mrs. Merrill took Alice and
Mary Jane over the next morning, it didn&#8217;t
work out as planned. Alice was entered
and found herself in the very same room and
only two seats away from Frances, which
seemed perfect. But there wasn&#8217;t room
for Mary Jane! The kindergarten was
crowded, very, very crowded, and new little
folks weren&#8217;t allowed to come in. Miss Gilbert,
the teacher, talked with Mary Jane a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
while and Mary Jane told her all the work
she had done and all the things she had
learned about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think, Mrs. Merrill,&#8221; said the
teacher finally, &#8220;that your little girl is ready
for the first grade. She seems very well
prepared. But they don&#8217;t take new first
graders so late in the year. Why don&#8217;t you
keep her out of school the rest of this term
and then next year, enter her in the first
grade?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill thought that was a fine plan.
There would be so many new sights to see
and things to learn in the city that Mary
Jane would find plenty to do.</p>
<p>But Mary Jane was keenly disappointed.
&#8220;I wanted to stay in Betty&#8217;s room,&#8221; she explained
to the teacher. &#8220;She asked me to
sit by her this morning, she did, and I promised
yes I would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll tell you what you may do,&#8221;
suggested the teacher kindly. &#8220;Two of our
folks are absent this morning so we have
enough chairs to go around. Wouldn&#8217;t you
like to stay with Betty and visit? And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
then just a little before time for school to
be out, Betty can take you up to your sister&#8217;s
room and she can bring you home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill agreed that that was a fine
plan, so Mary Jane went to the cloak room
to hang up her hat and her mother hurried
back home.</p>
<p>At first Mary Jane felt very strange in
the new school room. There were so many
children there and the songs were new and
the games were new and everything seemed
different. She almost&mdash;not really, but <i>almost</i>&mdash;wished
she had gone home with her
mother. And then, after singing three
songs Mary Jane didn&#8217;t know, the children
made a big circle and let Mary Jane stand in
the middle and they sang the song Mary
Jane knew so very well,</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to visit a friend to-day,
She only lives across the way,
She said she couldn&#8217;t come out to play
Because it was her &mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Quick as a flash Mary Jane dropped onto
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
her knees and began to act out packing
things into a box.</p>
<p>For a minute the children hesitated.
That was a strange thing to be acting; Mary
Jane was not washing or ironing or churning
or sweeping or any of the things the children
usually acted and they were all
puzzled. Then suddenly Betty remembered
the back stairway and all the piles of
boxes and excelsior on Mary Jane&#8217;s back
stairway and she called out the end of the
song&mdash;&#8220;because it was her moving day!&#8221;
And everybody finished the verse with a
flourish.</p>
<p>After that Mary Jane felt more at home
and the morning went oh, so very quickly,
till recess time, when they all went out into
the big yard to play in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Betty and her particular friends were
gathering together for a circle game in the
corner of the yard when Mary Jane heard
a soft, helpless little sound close at hand.
Without stopping to say anything to any
one, she ran over to the fence and there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
caught in between the tall iron bars, was the
tiniest, blackest little dog she had ever seen.
He evidently had seen the children coming
out to play, had wanted to play with them
and had supposed he could slip right
through between the bars of the fence.</p>
<p>Mary Jane tried to pull him out but he
was stuck fast. So she called Betty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; shouted one of the boys, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
pull him out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No you don&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Betty imperatively,
&#8220;you let him alone! We&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; And
her snapping black eyes flashed so positively
that the boy obeyed. But Betty couldn&#8217;t
pull the dog through either, the bars were
too close, she couldn&#8217;t move him either way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what let&#8217;s do,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Mary Jane, you stay here and guard him
so nobody tries to pull him out and I&#8217;ll go
and get Tom and he&#8217;ll know what to do.&#8221;
Tom was the janitor.</p>
<p>Mary Jane stood close by the dog and
patted his head and talked kindly to him so
he would know somebody was trying to help
him. And all the girls and boys who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
started to play together gathered around and
watched Mary Jane while Betty ran back to
the school building and down into the basement
to fetch the janitor.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Tom was in his office and
came quickly in response to Betty&#8217;s call.
He saw at once what the trouble was and
discovered a way to remedy it. It seems
that the big iron bars that made the fence
were heavier at the bottom than nearer the
top, so the space between the bars got wider
higher up. Tom took firm hold of the wiggling
little creature and gently but very
firmly pushed him straight up between the
bars. That didn&#8217;t hurt like trying to pull
him out, so the dog stopped barking and
whining. And in a second Tom had him
out&mdash;half way up the fence there was plenty
of room to lift him right through.</p>
<p>Poor little doggie! He was so glad to be
out and so frightened by his experience that
when Tom laid him down on the grass he
looked quite forlorn. Mary Jane sat down
beside him and gathered him up into her
arms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you be afraid, doggie,&#8221; she said
softly, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take care of you, don&#8217;t you be
afraid a bit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you going to do with him?&#8221; asked
one of the girls.</p>
<p>But Mary Jane didn&#8217;t have to answer that
question. Before she could speak, a small
boy came running along the street, crying as
hard as he could cry and shouting between
sobs, &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my dog! I&#8217;ve lost my dog!
Somebody&#8217;s stole my dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No they haven&#8217;t,&#8221; called Betty, &#8220;maybe
this is yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little boy rubbed his eyes, looked
through the fence&mdash;and a look of happiness
spread over his small face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s him! It&#8217;s him! It&#8217;s him!&#8221; he
shouted happily, &#8220;then he isn&#8217;t stole!&#8221;</p>
<p>It took only a minute to run around the
gate, dash across the school yard and grab
the tiny little dog into his arms. And the
children could tell by the way the little creature
snuggled down that the love wasn&#8217;t all
on one side&mdash;evidently the little boy was a
good master.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Right at that minute, before there was
a chance to start a game or any play, a great
bell in the school doorway began to ring.
Mary Jane was used to a small school of
course&mdash;a school so small that the teacher
came to the window and simply called when
recess was over. So she stared in amazement
when the great bell rang out so noisily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; shouted Betty, &#8220;recess is
over!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon as I tell this doggie good-by!&#8221; replied
Mary Jane.</p>
<p>Betty didn&#8217;t hear and, supposing Mary
Jane was right behind her, she went on into
her place in line. And Mary Jane, remembering
how leisurely folks went up after recess
at her old school, didn&#8217;t pay any attention
to the rapidly forming lines. She
turned around and patted the tiny dog and
nodded and smiled and whispered her
good-by.</p>
<p>When she did turn to go in with Betty, she
was amazed to see all the children had disappeared
into the building. She scampered
over to the door as fast as ever she could.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
And up the stairs&mdash;but not a soul did she
see! Only the click of a closing door could
be heard&mdash;a click that made Mary Jane feel
really shut out and lonely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s see,&#8221; said Mary Jane to herself,
&#8220;Betty&#8217;s room was right around a corner&mdash;&#8221;
But there wasn&#8217;t any room around
that first corner&mdash;only a long hall. A lump
came into Mary Jane&#8217;s throat. The building
was so big, so very, very big. And she
felt so little, so very, very little. She swallowed
twice, determined not to cry and then
she said out loud in a queer frightened little
voice, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;m lost. I&#8217;m lost in school!&#8221;</p>

<h2>SAND CASTLES</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I Guess I&#8217;m lost! I&#8217;m lost in school!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s frightened little whisper
sounded like a shout and the doors and
walls and hallways seemed to echo back,
&#8220;Lost! Little girl lost!&#8221; in a most desolate
fashion. Mary Jane was so frightened that
she stood perfectly still&mdash;just as still as
though her shoes were fastened to the floor.
And she looked straight ahead as though she
was trying to see through the wall at which
she was staring. To tell the truth, Mary
Jane wasn&#8217;t trying to see through the wall.
She didn&#8217;t even know a wall was in front of
her. She couldn&#8217;t see a single thing, not
even a big wall, because a mist of tears was
in her eyes and a great lump was growing in
her throat.</p>
<p>Now Mary Jane wasn&#8217;t a baby. And she
never cried&mdash;or any way, she <i>hardly</i> ever
cried because she was going on six and girls
who are going on six don&#8217;t cry. But to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
lost in a strange school and in a strange city
and&mdash;everything; well, it&#8217;s not much wonder
that Mary Jane felt pretty queer.</p>
<p>But before the tears had time to fall, there
was a heavy footstep behind her and Mary
Jane whirled around to see&mdash;the kindly face
of Tom the janitor smiling at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you pretty late getting to your
room?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Mary Jane couldn&#8217;t answer. She was so
relieved to have someone around that for
a minute she just couldn&#8217;t get the lump out
of her throat enough to talk.</p>
<p>Tom must have been used to little girls&mdash;maybe
he had one of his own&mdash;because he
didn&#8217;t pay any attention to Mary Jane&#8217;s silence.
He took hold of her hand and said pleasantly,
&#8220;Now don&#8217;t you worry a minute.
You just show me which your room is and
I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for it too,&#8221; said Mary Jane,
finding her voice again, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know
where it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know where your room is?&#8221; asked
Tom in surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Mary Jane with a decided
shake of her head, &#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221; And then, for
talking was now getting comfortable and
easy, she added, &#8220;you see, it isn&#8217;t really my
room. It&#8217;s Betty&#8217;s. And I&#8217;m just a-visiting
her. I&#8217;m just moved to Chicago and
they haven&#8217;t any chair for me only just to
visit in when somebody&#8217;s absent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like the kindergarten,&#8221; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; agreed Mary Jane with a laugh
of relief, &#8220;I&#8217;m kindergarten, I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then here we go, right down this way,&#8221;
said Tom, and off they started in just the opposite
direction.</p>
<p>Before they got clear up to the kindergarten,
though, they met Miss Gilbert, who
was coming in search of the little visitor.
&#8220;Betty missed her,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;but I
thought you&#8217;d find her, Tom.&#8221; With a
thank you to her janitor friend, Mary Jane
took tight hold of the teacher&#8217;s hand and
they went into the kindergarten room together.</p>
<p>After that, the morning went very quickly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
and happily and Mary Jane could hardly
believe her ears when the big whistles began
to blow for twelve o&#8217;clock and Miss Gilbert
told them to put away their scissors and
cut-out papers and get ready to go home.
Mary Jane had cut out two beautiful tulips
and she was very happy when she was told
they might be taken home as a souvenir of
her visit.</p>
<p>On the way home they met Frances and
Alice and Ed so they had plenty of company.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doing Saturday?&#8221; asked Ed
as they neared their own corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Alice, &#8220;is there
anything nice to do&mdash;special?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Frances, &#8220;we were
afraid you might all be busy&mdash;but&mdash;well
you see, we were going to have a beach party
and we thought maybe you folks would like
to go along. All of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Alice and Mary hadn&#8217;t the slightest
idea what a beach party was, only of course
they knew it must be something about the
lake. But there wasn&#8217;t time for questions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
and talk just then for Frances discovered
that they had walked so slowly that they
must rush on home to lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get mother to tell you,&#8221; she promised,
&#8220;and do say you&#8217;ll come &#8217;cause it&#8217;s a
fire and cooking and marshmallows and
piles of fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ve plenty of wires,&#8221; added
Betty, &#8220;and they&#8217;re plenty long so you won&#8217;t
burn your fingers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounded amazingly puzzling to Alice
and Mary Jane, who couldn&#8217;t in the least
understand what a fire and wires and all that
had to do with a beach. But they were to
find out before so very long. For that same
afternoon, while Alice was still in school,
Mrs. Holden and Betty came over to call
on Mrs. Merrill and Mary Jane and then
the beach party was all explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go over to the lake very often,&#8221; said
Mrs. Holden. &#8220;And on the sandy beach,
close by the water, the children build a big
fire. Then, when the coals are good, we
toast sandwiches and roast &#8216;weenies&#8217; and
toast marshmallows. The children are so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
anxious to show your girls just how it is
done,&#8221; she added, &#8220;and as the weather promises
to be warm and sunny I think we should
have an extra fine time.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was settled. And a person would
have thought from the excitement and fun
of preparation that the party was to be that
same day instead of twenty-four hours away.
For as soon as Alice and the older Holden
children came home from school, they all
set to work planning the menu and getting
out baskets and cleaning the wires on which,
so the Merrill girls learned, marshmallows
were held over the coals to be toasted.</p>
<p>But when everything that could be done
the day before, was finished, there was still
some time for play, so the children went
down into the Holden yard and the boys,
Ed and John, showed the girls how to run a
track meet&mdash;how to jump and vault and
race in proper track style. Alice and Mary
Jane thought the boys wonderfully skilled
and the boys, thrilled by such warm admiration,
broke all their previous records and had
a beautiful time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock the next afternoon the two
families set out for the beach party. And
it surely was quite a procession that made its
way the four or five blocks to the park.
First there was John with the wagon which
held all the heavy things&mdash;baskets of food
and such. Next came Ed, who started
out walking behind the wagon to see that
nothing dropped off. He and John were to
take turns pulling the load. Then the
others carried bundles of kindling and the
wires for marshmallows and toasting racks
for meat. They had such a jolly time getting
off that everybody felt sure the party
was to be a success.</p>
<p>Mary Jane had been so busy helping get
settled and all that, that she hadn&#8217;t had
time for a real visit on the beach. To be
sure she had had glimpses of the big blue
they could see down their own street, but to
really come over and see the lake and play
in the sand&mdash;this was her first trip. So she
skipped along very happily and thought she
could hardly wait till they got there.</p>
<p>Fortunately they hadn&#8217;t far to go. Three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
blocks down and two blocks over and there
was the park&mdash;such a beautiful park with
tiny lakes and bridges and great trees whose
buds were swelling in the warm afternoon
spring sunshine. Mary Jane thought she
must be in fairyland come to life, it was all
so beautiful. They crossed an arched
bridge; saw a lovely view off toward the
south where other bridges and lagoons and
trees made such a pretty picture they were
tempted to stay and look longer; walked
around a big circle where, so John told them,
the band gave concerts in the summer time;
circled a tiny little inlet lake and came out,
quite suddenly, right close to the big lake&mdash;Lake
Michigan. It almost took Mary
Jane&#8217;s breath way, coming suddenly that
way, upon the sight of so much water. It
was all so blue and clear, she thought, for
the minute, that surely it must be the very
same ocean she had seen in Florida only a
few weeks before.</p>
<p>But the boys didn&#8217;t give much time for
sight-seeing of lakes&mdash;they had seen the
good old lake many a time and they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
thinking more about supper than any view,
however pretty.</p>
<p>So they hurried their wagon across the
boulevard driveway, and of course all the
folks had to follow close behind, and down
the beach walk a couple of hundred yards
and there they settled themselves on a
stretch of clean white sand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said big brother Linn, whom the
girls hadn&#8217;t seen much of as yet, but who
seemed to be master of ceremonies, &#8220;you boys
gather those big logs down there, you girls
fix the kindling and I&#8217;ll set these stones up
so we get a good draft when we light our
fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody set to work. The logs proved
to be so big and heavy that Ed and John
were very glad to have the help of their
father and Mr. Merrill to roll them into
place. The four girls sorted out the kindling
in their basket and added to it by picking
up drift wood on the beach. Frances
explained that they always brought some
along to be sure they had some real dry
wood for a start.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>With such good help and so much of it,
of course it wasn&#8217;t long till a fine blaze was
going and the beach party was actually begun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead and play now,&#8221; said Linn,
when he saw the fire was started and that
there was a big pile of reserve wood close
by. &#8220;You know we can&#8217;t cook till we get
some coals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m starved,&#8221; hinted Ed, with a hungry
look toward the baskets his mother and
Mrs. Merrill were guarding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll have to stay starved, young
man,&#8221; said his mother, laughing, &#8220;because
not a basket is to be opened till the coals are
ready for cooking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s make a sand castle,&#8221; suggested
Betty and she ran down to a smooth place
on the beach, away from possible smoke, and
began molding the white sand.</p>
<p>That pleased Mary Jane. She hadn&#8217;t
forgotten the fun she had playing on
the beach in Florida, and while this beach
was different&mdash;it didn&#8217;t have any of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
pretty shells or funny little crawdads she
had found on the Florida beach&mdash;still it had
lovely white sand and dainty little waves
and was quite the nicest place for play that
Mary Jane had seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what let&#8217;s do,&#8221; suggested
Alice, as she saw that all the children were
going to play in the sand, &#8220;let&#8217;s each build a
castle and make it any way we like best and
then when they&#8217;re all finished, have an exhibition
and everybody look and see which
is the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, let&#8217;s,&#8221; agreed the children and
they set to work.</p>
<p>Mary Jane chose for her castle a place
down close by the water. She loved the
nearness of the waves and the thrill of knowing
that maybe, if she didn&#8217;t watch out, a
wave would come up really close and get
her wet. Betty picked out a spot nearer the
fire on the side away from the smoke and
Alice chose a place where a few pretty pebbles
would give her material with which to
pave a &#8220;moat&#8221; she intended to make.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>And then everybody set to work. So busy
were they that Linn had to tend the fire all
by himself and Ed forgot he was hungry.</p>
<p>Before very long that beach looked like a
picture book. Towers and ditches and castles
and bridges were where flat sand had
been a few minutes before. The Holden
children had made many a sand house and
they knew just how to pack the damp sand
so it would stay in place and just how to put
a small board here and there to hold a second
story or a tower straight and tall.</p>
<p>But with all their experience, Alice&#8217;s castle
was as pretty as theirs, or at any rate she
thought it was, and Mary Jane&#8217;s was quite
wonderful. She smoothed off the &#8220;garden&#8221;
in front of her palace, stuck in a few sticks
for flowers, made a pebbly path down to the
tiny lake she had scooped out at one side
and then shouted, &#8220;Mine&#8217;s done! Look at
mine!&#8221; and stepped aside so all could see
her handiwork.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 327px;'>
And then, sliding in the wet sand, she sat right down in<br />
the lake and sent a wave of ripples right over her castle <i>Page 61</i><br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>But Mary Jane wasn&#8217;t used to working so
close to the water and she forgot entirely
where she was! Instead of stepping to one
side, as she should have done, she stepped
backwards&mdash;straight into the big lake!
And then, sliding in the wet sand, she sat
right down in the lake and sent a big wave
of ripples&mdash;right over her castle and garden
and lake and everything and washed it all
away, every bit!</p>

<h2>THE BEACH SUPPER</h2>
</div>

<p>A minute before Mary Jane slid into
the lake, the beach was a scene of busy
building and fun. Linn tended the fire, the
grown folks gathered wood and visited and
guarded baskets and the children all were intent
on their sand castles. But with Mary
Jane&#8217;s tumble everything changed.</p>
<p>Sand flew helter skelter as the children
jumped hastily and ran to Mary Jane&#8217;s assistance;
castles were trampled on as though
they didn&#8217;t exist and fire wood and baskets
were all forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, you&#8217;re all right!&#8221; called
Mrs. Merrill as she ran toward her little
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming! Coming! Here!&#8221; shouted
Mr. Merrill reassuringly as he dashed over
to his little daughter, picked her up by the
shoulders and set her, safe and sound, on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
dry sand just in time to miss a fair sized
wave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m wet!&#8221; said Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you are,&#8221; laughed Mr. Merrill,
&#8220;but I guess things will dry and you&#8217;re not
so very awfully too wet&mdash;not enough to
spoil the party, is she, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill looked thoughtful and all
the children waited anxiously for her answer.
Would Mary Jane have to go clear
off home and miss the party and everything!
But it wasn&#8217;t to be as bad as all that. Mrs.
Merrill remembered the warm day, the glowing
sun that was still bright and warm and
she also remembered the hot fire Linn had
underway and the warm sand all around the
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she isn&#8217;t wet enough to spoil
the party,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill, much to every
one&#8217;s relief. &#8220;Only she&#8217;ll have to stay close
by the fire till she gets warm and dry. Suppose
we appoint her head cook and make her
stay right there where it&#8217;s hot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get dry then!&#8221; exclaimed Ed, so
fervently that they all knew he had had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
many a hot face from working by the fire
at previous picnics.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about your castles?&#8221; asked Mr.
Holden, &#8220;weren&#8217;t we to have an exhibit?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the castles! Dear me! In the excitement
of Mary Jane&#8217;s tumble, no one had
given a thought to the castles. They were
stepped on, and trampled down and all
matted down into the sand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just too bad!&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; exclaimed John, dismissing the
whole question of castles with one wave of
the hand, &#8220;who cares about castles! <i>We&#8217;re</i>
going to have supper.&#8221; And every one set
to work.</p>
<p>Mary Jane was supposed to be head cook,
but as she had never before been to a beach
party, she really didn&#8217;t know what to do.
So she simply stayed close by the hot fire
while the boys brought three benches and
made them in a triangle around the fire&mdash;a
little way back of course. Then Mrs.
Holden and Mrs. Merrill unpacked the
baskets and fixed a place on the bench for
each person. To be sure nobody was expected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
to sit on the bench&mdash;that would be
quite too proper for a beach party meal.
But the mothers put a paper plate and a cup
for each person on the benches and then they
put on the plate as many sandwiches and
pickles and cookies and everything as each
person was entitled to.</p>
<p>While they were doing this, Linn raked
down the hot coals, set in place a light wire
rack he had made and spread a couple of
dozen weenies out to roast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, Mary Jane,&#8221; he said to the
head cook, &#8220;you take this long fork. And
as soon as a weenie begins to sputter and
brown, turn it over so it browns on the other
side too.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a very important job, Mary
Jane could easily see, and she determined
that every weenie <i>she</i> cooked would be done
just to a turn. She bent over the fire till
her back got a crook in it; then she sat down
on the hot sand close to the coals and by the
time the weenies were done ready to eat she
was so dry and hot that she felt sure she had
never slipped into the lake&mdash;never!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>And all the time Mary Jane was cook,
Linn and Mr. Merrill stayed close to see that
the coals kept evenly hot and that no bit of
flame started up to burn the head cook.</p>
<p>At last the weenies were ready. Each
one was beautifully brown and was sizzling
and sputtering and sending a most tempting
odor to hungry folks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Form a line, folks,&#8221; said Mrs. Holden,
&#8220;ladies first!&#8221;</p>
<p>With much laughter, each person got their
own roll, which had been split and buttered,
and filed passed Mary Jane. And Mary
Jane, instructed by Linn just how to do her
job, picked up one weenie after another on
the long fork and dropped each one in an
open roll held out before her. It was a scary
job, for the sand was close below and Mary
Jane knew that weenies dropped into the
sand wouldn&#8217;t taste very good. But she
took her time&mdash;too much time, John thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be &#8217;fraid of any old sand,&#8221; he assured
her when she put his weenie in his
roll so very carefully, &#8220;I eat &#8217;em any way&mdash;sand
or not.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>Betty eyed Mary Jane a bit enviously.
This being chief cook and having a chance
to fill the rolls of each person must surely
be fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time we have a beach party,&#8221; she
announced between bites, &#8220;<i>I&#8217;m</i> going to fall
into the lake too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll save you the trouble,&#8221; replied Mr.
Holden understandingly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you be
chief cook without getting wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Betty needn&#8217;t have worried about Mary
Jane&#8217;s being willing to give up her job.
For there was one disadvantage in that position
Miss Betty hadn&#8217;t thought of and Mary
Jane had just discovered&mdash;the head cook
had no time to eat. And Mary Jane was
getting fearfully hungry. She was more
than willing to give up the big fork, let
Betty fill her roll for her and stand up with
the others to eat the good hot morsel.</p>
<p>Did anything ever taste as good as those
hot weenie sandwiches, eaten there on the
edge of Lake Michigan, with the fine lake
air blowing in their faces and the sunshine
warming them and making them forget the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
chill of the long winter? The Merrills
thought they had never had so much fun and
tasted such good things. Every weenie
(and there had seemed to be far too many)
was eaten up; every roll disappeared and
cookies and pickles and sandwiches just vanished
as though a warm breeze had melted
them away.</p>
<p>Supper over, the sun going down reminded
the children that they must get the
fire ready for dark. They scampered up
and down the broad beach, gathering together
all the pieces of drift wood they could
find. Later in the year wood along that
beach would be hard to find. But in the
early spring, before the driftings of the winter&#8217;s
storms had been burned up by picnickers
like themselves, there was plenty to be
had.</p>
<p>Linn and Ed put away the cooking rack
in the case they had made for it, the two
mothers packed up débris and burned it so
the beach would be left clean and tidy, and
all the others gathered wood. Such a lot
as they did find! Linn piled it on high and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
by the time the sun went to sleep in the
west, the fire was so bright that nobody noticed
the growing darkness. They all sat
around on the warm sand and sang&mdash;college
songs that the children had learned from the
fathers, school songs and popular songs that
they all knew. It was fun to sit there close
by the big lake, to watch the sparks fly upward,
to hear the waves swish against the
sand and to sing and sing as loud as they
liked.</p>
<p>But when the darkness settled down
enough so that mysterious shadows lurked
over every shoulder and the stars helped the
fire make a light, Ed announced, &#8220;Now let&#8217;s
play Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they did. Playing Indian, the Merrill
girls found, meant a queer follow-the-leader
game. Ed led off first and everybody had
to follow. He ran round and round the
fire, prancing and yelling like a wild man.
And the point of the game was for everybody
to do exactly as he did. They ran and
jumped and yelled till everybody was
breathless with exercise and laughter and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
was glad to sit down again and do nothing.</p>
<p>By this time the fire had again died down
to a bed of coals.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Now</i> it&#8217;s time for the marshmallows,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Betty. She was right, it
was.</p>
<p>The boxes of marshmallows were opened,
wires pulled out of the baskets and all the
children sat around the fire a-toasting.
&#8217;Twas just as Betty had promised. The
wires were plenty long enough so that no
fingers needed to be burned or dresses
scorched and the bed of coals was big enough
to make room for all.</p>
<p>Betty and Mary Jane thought they would
keep count and see who could eat the most,
but after six they lost count, and they ate
and ate till they simply couldn&#8217;t eat any
more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play still pond,&#8221; suggested Frances.</p>
<p>She stood up near the fire and announced,
&#8220;Twenty steps, two jumps, three hops and
a roll. One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>STILL POND</span>.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>As she said the numbers off, the children
began scampering to a place to safety. All
but Mary Jane. She wasn&#8217;t used to playing
on the slippery, slidy sand. And
though she started off just as big as anybody,
she slipped and stumbled and hadn&#8217;t more
than got to her feet when the words, &#8220;Still
pond!&#8221; were called. And after that she
couldn&#8217;t move but just to use the steps,
jumps, hops and roll Frances had given
them.</p>
<p>To make matters even more exciting,
Frances started off exactly in her direction.</p>
<p>But Mary Jane hadn&#8217;t played &#8220;Still
Pond&#8221; in her own yard for nothing. Perhaps
she hadn&#8217;t learned to run on slippery
sand as yet, but she did know how to play
that game. Instead of trying to quietly
take her twenty steps in an effort to get out
of Frances&#8217; way, she took two quick steps,
dropped down on the sand, gave one little
roll, and&mdash;was safely hidden under one of
the picnic benches they had used for supper!</p>
<p>Frances passed so close Mary Jane could
have touched her. Other folks were chased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and found, but Mary Jane&#8217;s hiding place
was undiscovered. Of course when she
rolled in under the bench, Mary Jane had
expected to roll right out again when somebody
else was caught. But when she found
that they couldn&#8217;t see her; that they went
right around close at hand, talking about her
and wondering where she was and all that,
she thought it was such a good joke that she
lay very still and watched.</p>
<p>She heard them asking each other where
she was seen last; she heard her father say
she couldn&#8217;t be so very far away; and she
saw them all start off in search of herself.
Then, just the minute their backs were
turned but before they had had time to be
really frightened, she slipped out from under
her seat, stood up close by the dying fire
and shouted, &#8220;Here I am, can&#8217;t you see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>They thought it a very good joke she had
played and Mary Jane was sure she would
always remember that the best hiding place
is often the nearest one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to go home,&#8221; said Mr. Holden,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
looking at his watch, &#8220;the fire&#8217;s most out and
the party&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;ll be another one, won&#8217;t
there?&#8221; begged Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have it next week,&#8221; said Betty.</p>
<p>The boys loaded up the empty baskets on
their wagon&mdash;not much of a load going
home! Mr. Merrill raked out the fire so no
harm would come to anything; Mr. Holden
gathered the children together and started
the line of march. It was a happy little
crowd that wandered homeward and they all
agreed with Mary Jane when she said,
&#8220;Well, anyway, I think a beach party&#8217;s the
mostest fun I know. It&#8217;s more fun than
moving!&#8221;</p>

<h2>MARY JANE GOES SHOPPING</h2>
</div>

<p>The days after the beach party seemed
to fly past on wings. First it was a
Monday and then, before a person could do
half the nice things planned, Saturday was
coming &#8217;round again and Alice was home
all day from school and fun for the four
Merrills could be planned. Mrs. Merrill
and Mary Jane took to doing all their &#8220;Saturday
marketing&#8221; on Friday afternoon so
they could have more time on Saturday for
trips and sight-seeing and all the lovely
things folks like to do when they&#8217;ve just
moved to a big city.</p>
<p>One Saturday morning, not so very long
after the beach party, dawned&mdash;not bright
and warm and sunny as Mary Jane had
hoped it surely would&mdash;but rainy and cold
and windy as some May mornings are sure to
be in Chicago. A cold northeast wind raced
across the city and folks had blue noses and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
shivery finger tips and not a single thing to
be seen looked like spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now just look at it!&#8221; exclaimed Mary
Jane as she stared out of the living-room
window, &#8220;and we were going to take a trip
through the parks and I was going to wear
my new hat and everything. And look!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we can&#8217;t go to the parks again for
another whole week!&#8221; bemoaned Alice,
&#8220;&#8217;cause there&#8217;s school!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just look!&#8221; exclaimed Mary Jane again
as a hard gust of wind tossed the rain against
the winds exactly as though Mr. Rain was
saying to Mary Jane, &#8220;Thought you&#8217;d go
out, did you? Well, look what I&#8217;m doing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You girls talk as though parks were the
only things to see in Chicago,&#8221; said Mrs.
Merrill as pleasantly and comfortably as
though there was no such thing as a disappointment
in the world.</p>
<p>Alice and Mary Jane turned away from
the window quickly. Something in their
mother&#8217;s tone of voice made them suspect
that the day wasn&#8217;t to be a disappointment
after all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny to me,&#8221; continued Mrs. Merrill
in a matter of fact voice, &#8220;that you folks
haven&#8217;t asked to go to the big stores&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
you like to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like to!&#8221; exclaimed Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would we?&#8221; cried Mary Jane. &#8220;But
we didn&#8217;t think about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll think about it now,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Merrill. &#8220;If you can hold an umbrella
down tight over your head so as not
to get your hat wet, I think we could manage
to get to the train without getting soaked.
And once down at the store, we could check
our wet umbrellas and shop and sight-see
through the stores all we wished to without a
bit of hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, may we really go?&#8221; asked Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Mrs. Merrill, pretending
to hesitate, &#8220;if you <i>really</i> care to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>That settled it and there was no more time
wasted talking about weather <i>that</i> morning.
Dishes were washed and beds were made
and dusting was done so quickly that the
little flat must have been quite surprised and
pleased with itself&mdash;it got put into rights so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
very quickly. Then Mary Jane got her
hair fixed nicely and a pretty hair bow put
on&mdash;the bow wouldn&#8217;t show very much under
the new hat, but even that little had to
be just right&mdash;and then, while mother fixed
her own and Alice&#8217;s hair, she put on a pretty
dress&mdash;not a party dress, of course, but a
nice, pretty, dark dress. Then they all put
on rubbers and raincoats and locked up the
doors and took their umbrellas and started
for the train.</p>
<p>Going down town on the train was fun.
In the city where Mary Jane lived before,
one could walk down town. Or if one
really wanted to ride, a street car hustled
one to the stores in about five minutes. But
in Chicago, so she discovered, she had to
have a ticket and go through a gate, and up
stairs and onto a platform and aboard a train
and everything just as though one intended
to go away, far off. The girls both liked to
ride down town. To be sure they couldn&#8217;t
see much of the lake, even though they did
ride right along beside it, because the rain
made it all look dim and gray and foggy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
But they knew the lake was there; they could
see the spray the waves made and once in a
while they could hear the noise of splashing
water above the roar of the train. All too
soon, for there was so much to see, the train
pulled into their station and the conductor
shouted, &#8220;Randolph Street! Everybody
out! Far&#8217;s we go!&#8221; And all the folks
aboard got their umbrellas ready and went
out into the rain.</p>
<p>Fortunately it was only a very little way
from the station to the big store where Mrs.
Merrill took the girls, so they didn&#8217;t have a
chance to get tired or very wet. And as
soon as they got indoors, Mrs. Merrill found
a checking place and they left wet umbrellas
and wet raincoats and wet rubbers and
started out for fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s awfully convenient&mdash;just
to leave things that way,&#8221; said Alice as she
settled her collars and cuffs and made sure
she was tidy, &#8220;and of course we&#8217;ll get them
back safely?&#8221; This checking system was
new to her and she wanted to be assured it
was all right.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure we will,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill.
&#8220;See? I have the checks for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Mary Jane, &#8220;let&#8217;s
begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Alice, &#8220;let&#8217;s. And let&#8217;s see
<i>everything</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Merrill; &#8220;shall
we take an elevator first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; answered Alice, &#8220;&#8217;cause then
we&#8217;d miss the first floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they &#8220;did&#8221; the first floor, seeing all the
handkerchiefs and jewelry and bags and
fans and pretty decorations and ribbons&mdash;Alice
could hardly leave those lovely ribbons&mdash;and
neckwear&mdash;Mary Jane saw five
different neckties she needed&mdash;and so many
things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they have anything left for the second
floor?&#8221; asked Mary Jane when they
finally got around to where they had started.</p>
<p>&#8220;You just see,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill.</p>
<p>And sure enough there were plenty of
things on the second floor, pretty dishes and
lamps and so many things that, really, Mary
Jane almost got tired looking at them all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>By the time they got ready for the third
floor, Mary Jane was wondering if there
were any seats in that store. Not seats
where you sit down to buy things, but really
seats where you just sit down whether you
buy anything or not. And sure enough
there were just those seats. Nice, big
comfy ones, that appeared to be made for
Mary Janes who went a-shopping and
wanted to sit down. The Merrills sat down
on a big couch and Mary Jane leaned back
ready to rest when&mdash;who should she see
right in front of her but Frances Westland!
The girl she met at grandmother&#8217;s house
nearly a year ago.</p>
<p>In a jiffy Mary Jane forgot all about
wanting to sit down. She slid down from
the comfortable couch, dashed after Frances,
who, not guessing that a friend was so near,
was hurrying by, and brought her back to
meet mother and Alice.</p>
<p>Then they all sat down for a visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not living here,&#8221; said Frances in
answer to Mrs. Merrill&#8217;s question, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been spending the spring with my auntie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
and going to school here. But just as soon
as school is out I&#8217;m going back home.
Mother needs me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; replied Mrs. Merrill,
who was much pleased with the little girl,
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure your mother misses you greatly.
But where are you living and can&#8217;t we see
you before you go and can&#8217;t you take lunch
with us to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed that Frances&#8217;s auntie lived in
the same part of the city the Merrills lived
in and there was every reason to believe that
the girls might see each other at least once or
twice in the little time left of the school
year.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe I can eat lunch with
you,&#8221; added Frances, &#8220;&#8217;cause auntie and I
have to hurry home.&#8221; So with a promise to
come to see them soon at the address Mrs.
Merrill wrote out on her card for Frances,
the friends said good-by.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll declare!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Merrill,
looking at her watch after Frances left them.
&#8220;It&#8217;s almost twelve o&#8217;clock already! And
we were to meet father at one. If you girls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
want to see anything of the toys and dolls
and playrooms, we&#8217;d better not be sitting
around here any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the girls did want to see the
toys and dolls and everything. When they
got to the fourth floor where all the children&#8217;s
things were kept, they were sorry they
had spent even a minute any place else.
For all the lovely dolls and marvelous toys
and enticing games and beautiful pictures
and fascinating puzzles made a person think
that Santa Claus&#8217;s shop and fairyland and
magic were all mixed up together and set
down in one place. The girls looked and
looked and looked. They &#8220;oh-ed&#8221; and
&#8220;ah-ed&#8221; and exclaimed till they couldn&#8217;t
think of anything more to say&mdash;and then
they kept right on looking just the same.</p>
<p>Mary Jane picked out the doll coat she
wanted Georgiannamore to have and Alice
selected a lovely desk. They agreed upon
a set of dishes and upon charming furniture
for their balcony&mdash;just the right size too.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll pretend we&#8217;ll buy it all,
mother,&#8221; said Mary Jane, who knew perfectly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
well she couldn&#8217;t buy all the things
she talked about getting, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll pretend
we&#8217;ll have it all sent up, that&#8217;ll be such fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they pretended and looked and looked
and pretended till they had been over most
all that part of the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;if we&#8217;re
to meet Dadah for lunch&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, goody!&#8221; cried Alice, &#8220;are we to meet
him here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not here,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;but in
this store in the lunch room and in ten minutes.
So we&#8217;d better wash our hands and go
to the lunch room floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Merrill was waiting for them and had
a table engaged close by a charming fountain
(&#8220;Just think of a fountain in a house!&#8221;
exclaimed Mary Jane when she spied it) and
all the time Mary Jane sat there eating, she
could look right over and watch the fishes
and she could hear the splash of the water.</p>
<p>But Mary Jane wasn&#8217;t thinking of fishes
or water just then. She was hungry. And
the things her father read to her sounded so
good&mdash;oh, dear, but they did sound good!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
She and Alice had a dreadfully hard time
deciding just what did sound the best. But
Alice finally decided on stuffed chicken legs
(she hadn&#8217;t an idea what they were but they
sounded good) and potato salad and strawberry
parfait. And Mary Jane chose
chicken pie&mdash;a whole one all her own&mdash;and
hashed brown potatoes and orange sherbet.</p>
<p>While the lunch was being fixed, Mr.
Merrill took Mary Jane over to the window
so she could look down, down, way down, to
the street below, where the folks appeared
so little and upside down and where the
automobiles looked like the ones they had
just seen in the toy department.</p>
<p>When the lunch came, it proved to be just
as good as the menu promised it would be
and the girls enjoyed every bite. Mary
Jane was afraid for a minute that she had
made a mistake. For Alice&#8217;s parfait came
in a tall glass, with a long spoon that made
the girls think of the story of the fox and
the goose and the banquet, and Mary Jane
was sure nothing she had ordered could be
as nice as parfait. But when the maid set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
the orange sherbet at her place, Mary Jane
was quite satisfied, for the ice was set in a
real orange, all cut out in dainty scallops
and trimmed with green.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yummy-um!&#8221; she whispered, happily.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you had this party, Dadah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dadah seemed to want everything to be
all right, for he had added to their order
some little cakes, done up in frilly papers
and unlike anything the girls had ever seen.
They almost hated to eat them, they were so
pretty, but cakes one cannot eat are not good
for much, Mr. Merrill reminded them, and
so the cakes were eaten up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Mary Jane, as she dabbled
her fingers in the finger bowl and ate up
the candy she found at the side of the tiny
tray, &#8220;what do we do next?&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
<h2>THE BUS RIDE</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What do we do next?&#8221; asked Mr.
Merrill, repeating Mary Jane&#8217;s
question. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure of this much&mdash;we must
do something <i>very</i> nice because it&#8217;s such a
nice day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Nice day</i>!&#8221; exclaimed Alice. &#8220;What in
the world are you talking about, Dadah?
This is the worst weather we&#8217;ve had since we
came to Chicago&mdash;but we don&#8217;t care &#8217;cause
we&#8217;re having such a good time anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Merrill laughed and replied, &#8220;Suppose
you look out of the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they left their cozy table, where nothing
but empty dishes told the story of their
delightful lunch party, and wandered over
to the window where Mary Jane had looked
down at the street not much over an hour
before. But what a difference! With a
sudden, unexpected shift of wind that only
the Chicago weather man knows how to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
bring about, the stiff, cold northeaster that
had brought the cold rain of the morning had
been sent off and in its place a warm breeze
from the south blew softly across the city,
bringing with it sunshine and warmth and
pleasantness for all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&#8221; exclaimed Mary Jane, much
puzzled, &#8220;where&#8217;s the rain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want it back?&#8221; laughed Mrs.
Merrill, and then she explained to the girls
something about the effect the big lake
might have on weather and told them that
one of the queer things about Chicago was
its sudden changes to good, or sometimes
bad, weather.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I was wondering,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill,
&#8220;if you folks wouldn&#8217;t like an hour of fresh
air and then, if you&#8217;re not through shopping
we can come back to the stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls hadn&#8217;t an idea what he might
want to do, but they were pretty sure it
would be fun. So they agreed that an hour
out of doors was just what they most wanted
and they went down to get wraps from the
check room. They left the umbrellas till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
later, put on their wraps and left the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill, &#8220;see that
big bus down there&mdash;we&#8217;re going for a ride
on the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a bus?&#8221; asked Mary Jane, who
had never heard the word before. But before
her father could answer they were
pushed into the crowd at the crossing, hurried
across and the next second Mr. Merrill
had hailed a great, lumbering, top-heavy
automobile and was helping the girls to step
aboard.</p>
<p>The &#8220;bus&#8221; proved to be a large-sized passenger
automobile, with a deck on top for
passengers who wished to ride in the open
air. Mary Jane and Alice were thrilled
with the fun of getting on it. It seemed
exactly like going aboard a house-boat on
wheels. They stepped into a little hallway
and then&mdash;and this wasn&#8217;t so easy because
the bus immediately began to move&mdash;they
climbed up a curving flight of stairs and
walked down an aisle&mdash;an awfully wiggly
aisle it was too!&mdash;to seats on the very front
row.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Then, before they had had a chance to
look around or feel at home, the conductor,
who stood at the back, shouted, &#8220;Low
bridge!&#8221; and everybody ducked their heads
while the great bus went under the elevated
railroad. Mary Jane felt, truly, as though
she must be a person in a story book&mdash;Arabian
Nights or something marvelous&mdash;because
surely the things that were happening
to her weren&#8217;t <i>really</i> happening.</p>
<p>But after the elevated was passed, the bus
rolled out onto Michigan Boulevard and
Mary Jane settled herself comfortably in
her front seat with her mother, smiled across
the aisle to Alice and her father and began
to feel really at home in her high perch.
By the time the bus had turned northward
and crossed the river, she began to
feel that riding on the top of a bus was the
thing she&#8217;d been wanting to do all her life.
It was such fun to sit up high and watch the
lake, so blue and beautiful in the sunshine,
the trees just getting a tinge of green at the
tips, the pretty houses that lined the parkway,
the people&mdash;it seemed as everybody in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
Chicago must be out in their &#8217;tother best
clothes&mdash;and most of all, it was fun to watch
the automobiles dart in and out of the crowd,
around the bus and beside it, till Mary Jane
was sure their driver must be some wonderful
being to be able to manage so that everybody
stayed alive!</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Mary Jane,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill, interrupting
Mary Jane&#8217;s sight-seeing, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you want to pay your fare&mdash;Alice is paying
ours.&#8221; He slipped two dimes into her hand
just as the conductor stepped to the front of
the bus. Mary Jane wasn&#8217;t quite sure what
she was to do with the dimes till she noticed
that the conductor had in his hand a queer-looking
thing like a clock, only it had a hole
in the top just the right size for a dime.
Into that hole Mary Jane dropped a dime.
And&mdash;&#8220;ding<i>ding</i>!&#8221; went a musical little
bell somewhere in the &#8220;clock.&#8221; Then she
dropped the other dime. And again the bell
sounded, &#8220;ding<i>ding</i>!&#8221; just as though it tried
to say &#8220;Thank <i>you</i>!&#8221; that way. Alice then
dropped her two dimes and Mary Jane had
the fun of hearing the bell again. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
thought she wouldn&#8217;t do a thing but watch
the conductor and listen to his bell all the
time he collected fares, but just as he
stepped back to get the next folks&#8217; money
the bus passed in front of the queer old stone
building with great tower that Mr. Merrill
said was the city water works building, and
of course that meant the girls wanted to hear
about when it was built and hear again the
story Mr. Merrill had started to tell them
several evenings before about how the great
Chicago fire started and how it burned up to
this very spot they were now passing.
Somehow, being at that place and seeing the
one building that stood through the fire
made the history stories seem very plain and
there were a lot of questions to be asked
and answered.</p>
<p>But buses don&#8217;t wait for questions&mdash;the
girls soon discovered that! Long before the
fire story was told they had raced up Lake
Shore Drive, passed its beautiful old homes,
and were turning into Lincoln Park. Here
it seemed to the girls that the city
ended and fairyland began. The grass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
seemed greener, the lake bluer and the trees
greener than any place they had seen; and
hundreds of tulips peeping up through the
ground here, there and everywhere, made
spots of bright vivid color and beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Mary Jane happily, &#8220;I
hope the bus goes on and on forever!
I&#8217;d like to keep on riding all the time!&#8221;</p>
<p>But when, a minute or two later, they
passed near the buildings of the Zoo, Mary
Jane forgot all about wanting to ride forever
and wanted to get out, right away quick
and see all the animals she had heard lived
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-day,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill, looking
at his watch. &#8220;You remember we are to go
back to the stores&mdash;we&#8217;re just out for a bit of
fresh air this time. Some other day when
it&#8217;s still warmer so we can get our dinner
here, then we&#8217;ll come and visit the Zoo.
But to-day I want to get back to the stores
before they close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; added Alice, &#8220;for our umbrellas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course for something else too,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
laughed her father, and though both girls
were very curious, not another word would
he say.</p>
<p>So they stayed on the bus and rode clear
through the park, and up Sheridan Road a
long way till the bus turned around at a corner
and the conductor shouted, &#8220;Far&#8217;s we
go!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Merrills didn&#8217;t get off. They
wanted to keep those good front seats so they
sat still and in about two minutes the bus
started south and whirled them through the
park and past all the same interesting
sights on the way cityward. This time,
Mary Jane felt very much at home in her
high-up perch. She dropped in the dimes
her father gave her, eyed the passing autos
without a bit of fear and looked down on all
the children she saw walking and playing
quite as though she had lived in a city and
ridden in busses all her young life.</p>
<p>It was a very reluctant pair of young
ladies that Mr. Merrill assisted to the sidewalk
when the big stores and &#8220;time to get
off&#8221; were reached.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But what was it besides umbrellas you
wanted to get?&#8221; asked Mary Jane, suddenly
remembering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been
through the toy department with anybody.
And I have a calendar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls looked puzzled. What had the
toy department to do with a calendar?
They couldn&#8217;t guess. Even Mrs. Merrill
looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course if you don&#8217;t intend to have
birthdays since we&#8217;ve moved&mdash;&#8221; said Mr.
Merrill teasingly. And then everybody
knew! To be sure! It was almost time for
Mary Jane&#8217;s birthday&mdash;almost a year, it
was, since the lovely birthday party when
the little girl was five years old&mdash;and in the
excitement of moving and getting settled
and seeing new sights, even the little lady
herself had forgotten how near the day was
at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mine!&#8221; exclaimed Mary Jane happily,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll be six! Come on, quick,
Dadah! and I&#8217;ll show you perzactly what I
want.&#8221; When Mary Jane got excited she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
sometimes got words a little mixed, but her
father knew well enough just what she
meant. She grabbed hold of his hand,
called to her mother and Alice to come on
with them and away they went toward the
elevator that quickly took them to the toy
section.</p>
<p>Going through that department the second
time was even more fun than the first
trip, because now father was along to
see things and to explain mechanical toys.
And also because there was the fun of picking
out the thing she wanted to wish for, for
her birthday. That last was a very serious
matter, as every little girl knows.</p>
<p>They looked at dolls&mdash;but not a doll was
as lovely as Georgiannamore, at least that
was Mary Jane&#8217;s opinion&mdash;and then they
looked at furniture and at dishes and toys
and games and clothes for dolls and, well,
at every single thing in that whole big department.
After everything had been considered
and looked at and thought about,
and it was about time for the big warning
bell to ring and tell folks that in ten minutes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the store would close and everybody&#8217;d have
to get out, then and not until then, Mary
Jane decided that the thing she wanted most
of all was a doll cart. A beautiful little
ivory enameled doll cart made just exactly
like the one that Junior&#8217;s little brother had
back at their old home. A cart with a top
that moved back and forth just like a real
baby cart and that had cushions and tires and
everything that a really truly mother is particular
to want for her baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mary Jane, as she looked
around the store with a rather tired sigh, &#8220;I
think that&#8217;s the thing I want the most and
I&#8217;m going to wish for it, Dadah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds easily settled,&#8221; laughed her father,
&#8220;but do you know what time it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before she could answer, the warning bell
rang and clerks began to cover up counters
and to straighten up the store for its Sunday
rest. So the Merrills four hurried down to
get umbrellas and to go home.</p>
<p>On the train going home Mary Jane was
so tired looking at things that she didn&#8217;t
care a bit about looking any more. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
watched the lake some, but mostly she simply
settled back in her little corner behind the
door and just sat. Thoughts of all the wonderful
things she had seen that day raced
through her mind&mdash;the lunch, the ride, the
lake, the park&mdash;but most of all, that wonderful
doll cart, and she couldn&#8217;t help wondering
(and of course hoping) if she really truly
would, <i>possibly</i>, get that lovely gift for her
birthday.</p>

<h2>THE BIRTHDAY LUNCHEON</h2>
</div>

<p>As soon as they got home that evening,
and had dinner and rested up a bit,
Mary Jane hunted up a calendar so she
could find out about her birthday. And she
discovered that two weeks from that same
day was &#8220;her&#8221; day.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Saturday, so you can do something
too!&#8221; she said to Alice. &#8220;Now, Mother,
let&#8217;s plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they talked over all the nice things a
person <i>might</i> do for a birthday, but long before
they could decide which was the very
nicest of all the plans, bedtime came. Then
the next morning there were interesting
things to do, and nobody thought about
plans for a day that was two weeks away.
That is, nobody but Mary Jane thought
about it, and, if the truth must be told, she
thought more about the doll cart she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
wished for than she did about what she might
do to celebrate.</p>
<p>Monday noon, when Alice came home for
her luncheon, she was much excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you s&#8217;pose I saw at recess this
morning?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;Guess!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Merrill and Mary Jane couldn&#8217;t
guess&mdash;they didn&#8217;t know anybody in Chicago
to guess! Or at least they thought
they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw&mdash;&#8221; began Alice slowly, for she
wanted the fun of keeping them waiting to
last as long as possible, &#8220;I saw&mdash;Frances
Westland! And she goes to my school!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why in the world didn&#8217;t we know that?&#8221;
said Mrs. Merrill. &#8220;We should have
guessed! Of course she goes to your school.
I remember of thinking she wasn&#8217;t very far
from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we have her come to see us?&#8221; asked
Mary Jane eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I already asked her if she couldn&#8217;t come,&#8221;
explained Alice, &#8220;because I knew you&#8217;d want
me to, and she says she&#8217;s sure she can. But
she can&#8217;t come next Saturday because she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
and her auntie are going to Milwaukee to
spend the week-end. But she thought she
could come the next Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s my birthday,&#8221; Mary Jane reminded
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; agreed Alice, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t
tell her. I just said I&#8217;d find out what we
were doing that day and let her know this
afternoon&mdash;was that all right, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did exactly right, dear,&#8221; said Mrs.
Merrill reassuringly. &#8220;Come right out to
the dining-room now, because your soup is
ready and you mustn&#8217;t hurry yourself too
much with your lunch. While we eat, we&#8217;ll
plan for the birthday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course there were many plans to be
talked of, because in a big city there are so
many kinds of things one may do. And it
was awfully hard to decide which plan was
the very most fun&mdash;you know how that is
yourself. But after every plan that any of
the three could think of had been discussed
carefully, Mary Jane decided that there
were two things she wanted the most to do.
First, she wanted to stay home to celebrate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and have a party and all that; and, second,
she wanted to go down town and go to a big
grown-up theater where there was music and
lights and pretty things just like grown
folks see up town. And for her part she
admitted that she didn&#8217;t see how a person
possibly, even on a birthday, could do those
two conflicting things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; laughed Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;that&#8217;s
easy! I was telling Dad the other night
that inasmuch as this was the first birthday
in the city and on Saturday and everything&mdash;so
convenient for us all&mdash;we&#8217;d better do
those very two things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how&#8217;ll we do it, Mother?&#8221; asked
Alice. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stay home for a party
while we&#8217;re down town at the theater!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, we can&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Merrill.
&#8220;But we can stay home for a party
<i>before</i> we go down town for a show. And
that&#8217;s just what we&#8217;re going to do. You
hurry off to school now, dear, because it&#8217;s
ten of one. And next time you see Frances
Westland, you invite her to come here for
twelve o&#8217;clock luncheon a week from next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Saturday. Be sure to tell her it&#8217;s an all-afternoon
party, so she can stay long enough to
go down town with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who else&#8217;ll we have?&#8221; asked Mary
Jane, when Alice had gone. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t
be a party with one person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said her mother.
&#8220;There are going to be three folks. After
school this very day you are going to invite
Frances and Betty Holden&mdash;that&#8217;ll make it
almost a &#8216;Frances&#8217; party, won&#8217;t it? We&#8217;ll
ask them right away, even though a week
from Saturday is a long time off, because
Dadah will want to get the tickets and we
will all want to make our plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>A week and five days seem a very long
time, when you have to wait for them. But
Mary Jane found that, after all, they went
quicker than she had thought they could, because
there was so much to do. First she
had to decide what she wanted to have to
eat at the luncheon. After much thought
and consultation the menu was made out
and tacked up on the kitchen cabinet for future
reference. Mary Jane printed it out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
all by herself and the letters were big and
plain and could be easily read by any cook&mdash;especially
Mother. It said:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p>Chicken balls really meant chicken croquettes,
but croquettes proved to be such a
big and puzzling word that Mary Jane decided
she would say balls and Mrs. Merrill
agreed to take a verbal order for the croquette
part of the luncheon.</p>
<p>When the food was planned for, Mary
Jane began to talk about the decorations.
It was soon found that to be really pretty,
the table trimmings would have to be made
by the hostess herself, so Mary Jane set to
work. From the advertising sections of
magazines she cut letters about an inch high.
Letters enough to spell everybody&#8217;s first
name and last initial. She had to have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
last initial because two of her guests had
the same first name. These she sorted very
carefully and put in envelopes; one envelope
for each person and just the right letters
in that envelope for the person&#8217;s name.
Then, she planned, when the luncheon was
all ready, she would put the letters in little
piles in front of each person&#8217;s place and let
them puzzle out the names before they sat
down.</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill promised to have a basket of
flowers, spring flowers that Mary Jane loved
so very much, in the center of the table.
And Mary Jane planned to make a procession
of girls and boys all around the basket.
These she cut out of magazines too and she
chose girls and boys who were doing all the
things that she herself liked to do.</p>
<p>With all these things, besides regular
duties and fun, to keep her busy, Mary Jane
didn&#8217;t really have a chance to think her
birthday was a long time coming. First
thing <i>she</i> knew it was Friday night and the
birthday was the very next morning!</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, she waked up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
knowing something nice was going to happen.
Then, before her eyes were really
open, she felt herself getting mother&#8217;s birthday
kisses and, before those were all delivered,
Alice&#8217;s birthday spats&mdash;six good big
lively ones!</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind, Alice,&#8221; she promised,
&#8220;just wait till it&#8217;s <i>your</i> birthday and you&#8217;ll
get some of the hardest&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop for promises,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill,
coming in to deliver his spats too, &#8220;what
I want is breakfast and for the life of me, <i>I</i>
can&#8217;t get into that dining-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oh!</i>&#8221; cried Mary Jane rapturously, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be right out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till you get dressed, you know,&#8221;
Alice reminded her, &#8220;so do hurry!&#8221; For it
was one of the rules of the Merrill household
that birthdays and Christmases didn&#8217;t
really begin till folks were dressed. So
Mary Jane scrabbled into her clothes and
gave her face and hands about the most
hurry-up washing they had ever had and
then rushed out to the dining-room.</p>
<p>And there, standing right by her chair, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
the&mdash;yes, really&mdash;the very doll cart she had
picked out! She was so happy that for a
minute she couldn&#8217;t speak, she just stared.
The next minute she was down on her knees
with her arms around the whole cart&mdash;or at
least as much of the cart as two six-year-old
arms could get around&mdash;and she was counting
over all the wonderful virtues of her
gift. It surely was a cart to make any little
girl proud and when Mary Jane saw her own
Georgiannamore, wearing a lovely new coat
(Mrs. Merrill&#8217;s gift), and a pair of really
truly gloves (from Alice), and sitting up as
big as life in the cart, she thought the happiest
day of her life had come.</p>
<p>After breakfast the morning raced by on
wings. Of course Mary Jane had to show
the cart and doll&#8217;s clothes to Betty and they
had to walk around the block to give the doll
an airing. Then, just as they got back to
Mary Jane&#8217;s apartment, the postman came
with a box from grandpa and grandma.
Betty was invited up for the fun of opening
it and she was glad to come both for the fun
and for the big pieces of grandmother&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
candy that she got when the box was opened.
Then there was the table to set and the puzzle
letters to put around and everybody to
dress in their best&mdash;that&#8217;s a good deal for
one morning. No wonder it seemed to be
an unusually short one.</p>
<p>At the very last minute, Mary Jane with
her new white dress and pink ribbons all
just as they should be, went in to the kitchen
to see if she could help. And at that very
minute a neighbor came in to get Mrs. Merrill&#8217;s
advice about an important matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s ready now,&#8221; said Mrs.
Merrill, as she left the kitchen. &#8220;Only, I
believe, Mary Jane, it would be a good idea
for you to put that whipped cream into the
ice box. We won&#8217;t make the salad till they
get here and I want to keep it stiff and cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Mary Jane had put things in the ice
box many a time. Big things and little
things and spilly things and all, and there
was no reason in the world why she couldn&#8217;t
do it all right. No reason, except&mdash; Just
as she picked up the bowl of cream, the door
bell rang a long, loud peal that she was sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
must be her three guests coming all at once,
so she hurried and the cream jiggled in the
bowl, and slid over the edge&mdash;and all down
the front of her best new dress!</p>
<p>Fortunately Alice came into the kitchen
just then, in time to see the accident, and
to notice two big tears which popped into
Mary Jane&#8217;s eyes and threatened to spill
down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; she exclaimed comfortably,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you worry about a little thing like
that, Mary Jane,&#8221; and she made a grab for
the bowl, rescued some of the cream and set
it in the ice box. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have you fixed up so
soon that you won&#8217;t know anything happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s all down my dress,&#8221; said Mary
Jane, trying her very best not to cry.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;But it&#8217;s all down my dress,&#8221; said Mary Jane, trying her<br />
very best not to cry <i>Page 111</i><br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; replied Alice, nothing
daunted, &#8220;it&#8217;s not going to stay there long.&#8221;
She took a clean cloth, dampened it with
cold water and, with quick little dabs,
scrubbed the cream all off the front of the
birthday dress. Then she took a fresh cloth,
and more cold water and, putting a big, clean
towel under the front of the dress, scrubbed
again till every trace of the cream was gone.
Then she opened the oven door so the heat
would help dry the wetness and with a fresh
cloth rubbed and rubbed the wet place till it
was entirely dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now,&#8221; she said, as she shook the
dress into place, &#8220;I think the girls are here;
let&#8217;s go see.&#8221; And immediately the accident
that threatened to spoil Mary Jane&#8217;s
fun was forgotten.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the girls had come and the
party began at once.</p>
<p>The letter puzzles for place cards proved
to be lots of fun and filled in the time while
Mrs. Merrill brought in the plates of good
things to eat. Judging by the appetites
Mary Jane&#8217;s menu must have been a favorite
with everybody, for the goodies disappeared
by magic and Mrs. Merrill filled up plates
and passed rolls and brought in salad and
everything till she hardly had time to eat her
own luncheon.</p>
<p>The ice cream was a surprise even to Mary
Jane. On the plate was, first, a big, round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
piece of cake; then, on top of that, was a slice
of ice cream, white, and on top of <i>that</i> a ball
of pink ice cream with a pink candle,
lighted, stuck in the top. They looked so
pretty and bright that the girls hated to blow
them out, but Mrs. Merrill said every one
was to make a wish and then blow and if the
candle went out on the first blow the wish
would come true.</p>
<p>Alice suddenly remembered that they were
to take a train at one-thirty and that it was
nearing one now, so the dessert was finished
in a hurry, wraps were hastily put on and the
whole party started for the train to meet Mr.
Merrill and have the rest of the fun.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
<h2>LOST&mdash;ONE DOLL CART</h2>
</div>

<p>There was only one thing wrong
about the birthday celebration and
that was that the day was such a very busy,
happy one that there was very little time for
playing with the new doll cart. Of course
Mary Jane and Betty took their dolls out
for one airing in the morning soon after
breakfast. But what is one little airing
when one has a new cart? Nothing at all,
Mary Jane thought. All through the luncheon
and the ride down town and the play
father took them to, which proved to be just
the very most interesting kind of a play for
little girls to see, Mary Jane kept thinking
of her new cart and of the fun she would
have on Monday when there was a whole
day for Georgiannamore and the doll cart.</p>
<p>So when Monday morning actually came
Mary Jane lost no time getting up and doing
her share of the morning work. Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
Jane was very particular about her morning
work. She didn&#8217;t want her mother to have
to do the things a six-year-old girl was
plenty big enough to do; and then, anyway,
she knew it was lots more fun to work when
two did the job than for one person to work
alone. She picked up all the papers, and
emptied the waste baskets, and cleaned the
bathroom washstand and the kitchen sink&mdash;she
liked those jobs the best because they
were so scrubby and grown-up and interesting&mdash;and
put out clean towels and dusted
the living-room. Of course this was after
the dishes were washed and put away; that
was a job with which Alice helped too, before
she started for school. So by the time
Mary Jane was ready to play Mrs. Merrill
was about through too, ready for sewing or
baking or whatever she had to do that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better help you take down
your cart,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Merrill, when the
last job was finished. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so easy for
one person to take that cart down from the
second floor. But it will be no trouble at
all for you to take one end and me to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the other and carry it down together. Then
you can put Georgiannamore in it before you
start down and there&#8217;ll be no danger of
bouncing her out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how&#8217;ll I get back up, Mother?&#8221;
asked Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ring the bell three short taps and I&#8217;ll
come down to meet you,&#8221; answered Mrs.
Merrill. &#8220;Don&#8217;t try to bring it up alone;
it&#8217;s far too heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane dressed Georgiannamore in
her very best dress, put on the new coat and
gloves, tucked her carefully into the cart so
she wouldn&#8217;t catch cold by being out for a
long walk, and then she and Mrs. Merrill
carried the cart, oh, so very carefully, down
stairs and out to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that May morning was
bright and sunny; the breeze blew warm
from the southland instead of cold and blustery
from the lake, and it was the very
best kind of a morning possible for being out
of doors. Mary Jane walked around the
block, starting toward the lake, then she
went around the block the other way, and of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
course she went rather slowly because there
was so much to see and to show Georgiannamore.
Bright colored crocuses were blooming
in all the yards where there were houses&mdash;and
in that particular neighborhood
there were many houses as well as apartments&mdash;tulips
were bursting up through the
ground and the lilac buds were swelling
their plump green sides nearly to the bursting
point.</p>
<p>On the third time around, Mary Jane
thought of school&mdash;to be sure, it couldn&#8217;t be
anywhere near time for school to be out, because
the morning hadn&#8217;t much more than
begun, but then it would be fun to go around
to the corner where the children crossed the
street to go to school. There were so many
automobiles whizzing around the streets
that a little girl even as old as six couldn&#8217;t
be allowed to cross streets without a grown
person or an older sister along.</p>
<p>She went around the block to the corner
where the children would come, after a
while, and there, just as she turned to start
back home, thinking she&#8217;d come here again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
nearer noon, she heard a commotion. Looking
down the half block to the yard around
the school house she heard a bell peal out
and saw, yes, truly, crowds of children coming
out of school! And just as she was
about to look around to see if there was a
fire or a parade or anything special to cause
school to be dismissed early, she heard the
whistles blow for noon&mdash;the morning was
gone! That&#8217;s how time flies when a person
has a new doll cart!</p>
<p>Mary Jane waited at the corner till Alice
and Frances and Betty came along together
and they all four walked home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t bother to carry your cart
clear upstairs every time,&#8221; suggested Frances,
&#8220;when our front porch is so handy.
Just run the cart up on the porch, lock the
brake and it will be safe as can be till you
eat your lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice thought that was a good idea too, so
the cart was left there, locked with the
brake, and with the understanding that if
Mrs. Merrill didn&#8217;t approve, the girls would
come down and get it at once.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Lunch was ready and waiting, so the cart
stayed on the porch while the girls ate and
then Mary Jane walked back toward school
as far as she was allowed to go.</p>
<p>By the time Mary Jane got back in front
of her own apartment, Mrs. Merrill was
ready to go and do her marketing and errands
and of course Mary Jane and Georgiannamore
went along and had a beautiful
time&mdash;especially when they looked in the
windows and saw all the good things to eat.
Mary Jane had thought that she knew every
sort of good thing a person could possibly
want to eat, but she soon found out that she
didn&#8217;t. For in one of the windows they
passed she saw a tray of apples, covered with
something slick and brown and carrying in
their stem ends a small smooth stick like a
butcher&#8217;s skewer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they, Mother?&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t they look <i>good</i>! And may we buy
some?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill went inside the store and
Mary Jane, anxiously watching her mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
through the window, waited outside with the
doll and cart. She saw her mother speak to
the salesman, look at the apples and then,
oh, joy! saw him pick out four fine ones under
Mrs. Merrill&#8217;s direction and put them
in a paper bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says they are called Taffy Apples,&#8221;
explained Mrs. Merrill when she came out,
&#8220;and that all the girls and boys like them
very much. So I didn&#8217;t bother to consult
you,&#8221; she added with a twinkle in her eye.
&#8220;I bought some for you four girls to eat after
school&mdash;just on a chance that you might like
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bag was carefully tucked in under the
folds of Georgiannamore&#8217;s robe and the
walking and shopping were resumed, but all
the time, Mary Jane kept her eye on the
hump made by the bag of apples and kept
wishing that time for school to be out would
hurry up and come. Some good fairy must
have heard the wishes too, for the afternoon
hurried by almost as fast as the morning and
first thing Mary Jane knew they were all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
through the errands and were going down
the street toward the school, ready to meet
Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like &#8216;Taffy Apples&#8217;?&#8221; Mary Jane
asked Betty as soon as she came out of the
school yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like &#8217;em&mdash;u-um!&#8221; replied Betty expressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Mary Jane slowly, so
the surprise wouldn&#8217;t be over too soon, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got one in there,&#8221; pointing to the cart.</p>
<p>Betty eyed the hump Mary Jane pointed
out and smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like more than one,&#8221; she suggested
hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is more than one,&#8221; answered Mary
Jane delightedly; &#8220;it&#8217;s four&mdash;all for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we eat &#8217;em now?&#8221; demanded Betty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait till we get home,&#8221; suggested
Mrs. Merrill; &#8220;that won&#8217;t be more than five
minutes and then there won&#8217;t be any danger
of stumbling and running a stick into your
throats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two little girls didn&#8217;t loiter much
after that. They skipped along briskly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
soon were ahead of Mrs. Merrill and Alice
and Frances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what,&#8221; said Betty, as they
turned into her own yard, &#8220;let&#8217;s put the cart
up on the porch while I get my doll and then
when we get through eating our apples we&#8217;ll
be all ready to go walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>She picked up the front end and Mary
Jane took the handle end and they set the
cart up at the end of the porch and went into
the house. Fortunately Mary Jane took
Georgiannamore along with her into the
house; if she hadn&#8217;t&mdash;but then, that&#8217;s getting
ahead of the story.</p>
<p>The little girls had no more than gone inside
before Mrs. Merrill, Alice and Frances
turned the corner and strolled along toward
the Holden house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny where those girls have gone,&#8221; said
Frances, looking at the empty porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve hid our Taffy Apples somewhere,
I just know they have!&#8221; said Alice.
&#8220;Frances, we ought to be smart enough to
find them so quickly they won&#8217;t try teasing
again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve hidden the apples,&#8221;
said Frances thoughtfully, &#8220;because
Betty would be so hungry she wouldn&#8217;t
bother with teasing till after she was
through eating. Maybe they&#8217;ve gone into
the house to get Betty&#8217;s doll and cart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why would they bother to take
Mary Jane&#8217;s cart indoors if Betty was just
going in for her doll?&#8221; asked Alice.</p>
<p>Before Frances or Mrs. Merrill could suggest
an answer, the two little girls themselves
came out of the front door, turned to
look at the porch and then stood there, as
though fastened to the floor&mdash;they were that
surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&#8221; said Mary Jane, &#8220;I left
it right here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, nobody ever stole anything before,&#8221;
said Betty. &#8220;Maybe the boys just
hid it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they didn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Frances, &#8220;because
they haven&#8217;t come home from school
yet. They stopped to see Jimmie&#8217;s new
chicken house and they won&#8217;t be home for
an hour.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; asked Mrs. Holden,
who, hearing voices, came to the front
door to invite folks in for a visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble enough, Mother,&#8221; said Frances,
worriedly. &#8220;Mary Jane left her brand new
doll cart on our porch and it&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we just went in to get my doll,&#8221; explained
Betty, getting very excited. &#8220;We
just went in a little minute and then we
were going to eat the taffy apples and now
they&#8217;re gone too&mdash;oh, dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that minute, yes, things really do happen
this way sometimes, who should go by
the house but the big friendly policeman
who always stood at the street corner nearest
the school to guard the children from swiftly
moving autos. Betty spied him and ran
down the walk to speak to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the cart&#8217;s gone, is it?&#8221; he said as he
and Betty came up toward the house.
&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;ll let me use your &#8217;phone, I&#8217;ll
tell them down at the station just what kind
of a cart it is and maybe we can get a trace of
it&mdash;anyway, we can try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Holden went indoors with him and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the others stood around on the porch hardly
knowing what to do. Losing her cart was
a real calamity to poor Mary Jane&mdash;she very
well knew that her father couldn&#8217;t afford to
get her another one and she had hard work,
awfully hard work, to keep back the tears
that came to her eyes and to swallow the
lump that filled her throat. She didn&#8217;t
want to be a crybaby, but&mdash;and the lump got
bigger and bigger&mdash;</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill noticed that Mary Jane was
trying so very hard to be brave so she did
her best to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it lucky that officer came by just
then!&#8221; she said cheerfully. &#8220;I can&#8217;t for the
life of me see why anybody would be mean
enough to steal a little girl&#8217;s doll cart and I
keep thinking we&#8217;ll find it somewhere.
Come on, Mary Jane, let&#8217;s sit down on this
settee here till Mrs. Holden comes out.
Then perhaps some of you girls will be good
enough to go up to the candy shop with me
and get some more taffy apples&mdash;I suppose
those went with the cart!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane stepped over toward her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
mother, who had already seated herself on
the settee at the end of the porch. But before
she sat down she just happened to look
down toward the ground. The Holden
porch had no railing around the side and as
Mary Jane was always a little timid about
falling she kept a close watch on the end of
the porch every time she went near it. She
glanced down at the ground and then&mdash;her
face changed! The sorrowful look vanished
and smiles spread like sunshine over
her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she pointed to
the ground. &#8220;Look there!&#8221;</p>

<h2>A TRIP TO THE ZOO</h2>
</div>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t hard to guess what Mary Jane
had found; nothing but her precious doll
cart could have made her feel and look so
happy. They all ran to the end of the
porch, looked over the edge, and there, sure
enough, was the birthday cart all tumbled
down in a heap. Alice and Frances jumped
down, set it up straight and then, with Mrs.
Merrill&#8217;s help from above, lifted it up to the
porch just as the policeman and Mrs. Holden
came out of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; exclaimed the officer.
&#8220;Another cart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s mine!&#8221; cried Mary Jane happily.
She ran her hands over the hood, the body
part and then the wheels to make sure nothing
was broken. Everything seemed all
right, even the bag of taffy apples was still
tucked under the carriage robe that had come
loose but had not fallen clear out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yours?&#8221; asked the officer. &#8220;But I
thought yours was lost!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; admitted Mary Jane, &#8220;but it
isn&#8217;t any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill hastened to explain that the
cart had just then been discovered on the
ground at the end of the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what was the trouble,&#8221; said Frances,
&#8220;she didn&#8217;t fasten the brake&mdash;did you,
Mary Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane and the policeman bent down
to inspect the brake. No, it wasn&#8217;t fastened.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t take much of a breeze to
blow that cart off the porch, young lady,&#8221;
said the officer, laughingly, &#8220;and so I suggest
that if you ever want to leave your doll in
the cart, you&#8217;d better be sure the brake is
locked. You might have a smashed doll instead
of a lost cart to report and then things
wouldn&#8217;t be so easy to straighten out!&#8221;
And with a pleasant good-by he went on
about his business.</p>
<p>Left alone the two mothers looked at each
other and laughed&mdash;such an easy ending to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
disappointment didn&#8217;t often come! The
four girls made a dive for the bag of apples
and settled themselves on the broad
front steps for a few minutes of real enjoyment.
Mary Jane found that taffy apples
were a lot of fun to eat. The hard, slick
surface was delicious to &#8220;lick&#8221; and then,
when a small part was licked thin, it was
fun to bite right straight through to the apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think they&#8217;re good now,&#8221; said
Frances, &#8220;you should taste them in the fall
when the fresh apples are in&mdash;yummy-um!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are good enough for me,&#8221; said
Betty contentedly and she bit off a big chunk
of apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Betty Holden!&#8221; exclaimed Frances with
big sisterly chagrin, &#8220;you look like a monkey
with that apple all over your face!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fiddle!&#8221; replied Betty indifferently,
&#8220;I like monkeys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see one?&#8221; asked Mary
Jane, &#8220;a really truly live one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Betty stared. &#8220;Why of course!&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>Mary Jane shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then you ought to go up to the
Zoo,&#8221; she said positively, &#8220;let&#8217;s all go.&#8221;
She jumped up and ran over to her mother.
&#8220;Mother!&#8221; she announced, &#8220;Mary Jane&#8217;s
never seen a monkey&mdash;never! Can&#8217;t we
take her up to the Zoo and show &#8217;em to
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never seen a monkey!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Holden and she was as surprised as Betty
had been, &#8220;are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Betty&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill.
&#8220;Mary Jane has seen a great many things
for a little girl who has just had her sixth
birthday. But she hasn&#8217;t seen a monkey.
Her father and I were saying only last night
that we must take the girls up to the Zoo as
soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go next Saturday,&#8221; suggested
Mrs. Holden, &#8220;no, we can&#8217;t go next Saturday
because the girls and I have some shopping
to do. Let&#8217;s go a week from Saturday.
By that time the restaurant in Lincoln Park
will be open. The way we do,&#8221; she explained
to the Merrills, &#8220;is to take our lunch,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
a picnic lunch, with us. We start up about
eleven, eat over by the lake and then
have the whole afternoon for watching the
animals; we eat dinner in that nice restaurant,
before dark, and then come home in the
early evening. Can you all go on that
day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill said she was sure they could,
so plans were made right then and there.</p>
<p>Mary Jane and Alice thought those two
weeks, or nearly two weeks, never would
pass. Of course there was the doll cart to
play with and Mary Jane loved it exactly as
much as ever. But she did want to see the
monkeys, and the foxes (Betty told her she
would love the foxes!) and all the creatures
that Betty seemed to know so much
about and which she had never even seen.</p>
<p>But at last the morning came, warm and
sunny and clear and the lunch boxes were
packed, the apartment locked up and everybody
started toward Lincoln Park feeling
happy and ready for fun. The fathers
couldn&#8217;t come for lunch, but really when all
the Holden girls and boys were added to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
three Merrills, there was such a crowd that,
for the time at least, fathers weren&#8217;t so very
much missed.</p>
<p>When they reached the park Mary Jane
realized, for the first time, how close it was
getting to really truly summer. The sun
shone with real summer warmth, the lake
was blue and beautiful and flowers bloomed
on every corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d just like to live in a park all the
time,&#8221; she exclaimed as she looked around
her, &#8220;it seems just like home!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it does,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill, with a
wee bit of a sigh, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I know some
folks who are going to miss their gardens
and flower bed this summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How stupid of me not to have thought
of that!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Holden. &#8220;You
know it will be just two weeks now till we
go up to the lake for all the summer. Why
didn&#8217;t I think to have you plant stuff in our
back garden? Then you could have all the
garden you liked right there handy&mdash;we always
do hate to leave the ground idle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we might plant something even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
yet,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Merrill, much delighted
with the idea, &#8220;we&#8217;d love to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no time for further planning
just then&mdash;John Holden demanded his
lunch; Betty made a lively second and in a
minute or two a clean grassy place was
picked out, the individual lunch boxes were
passed out and then, for a few minutes,
everybody was quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to feed the black bear,&#8221; announced
Betty, as she paused to pick out
another sandwich, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to feed him
peanuts&mdash;I saved up enough money for two
bagsful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t you afraid of him?&#8221; asked
Mary Jane breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid? Pooh!&#8221; grunted Betty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind, Mary Jane,&#8221; said Linn
comfortingly, &#8220;she was afraid the first time
she saw him and I remember all about it.
But now she&#8217;s learned that he can&#8217;t get out
the cage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Linn, I never&mdash;&#8221; began Betty.</p>
<p>But John interrupted. &#8220;There!&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m through. Come on, let&#8217;s gather up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
boxes and papers and stick &#8217;em in the trash
box on the way to get the peanuts.&#8221; So the
children all helped and in a jiffy the pretty,
grassy spot where they had eaten lunch was
as clean and tidy as when they came. And
then away they scampered after the peanuts.</p>
<p>Such an afternoon as it was! Mary Jane
tried to remember each thing they did so she
could tell her father when he met them after
three o&#8217;clock. But she couldn&#8217;t remember
half what they had done. She knew they
saw the little foxes&mdash;such pretty, dainty
white and tan colored foxes that played together
like little pet kittens and made her
want to hold them in her lap and pet them.
She knew they saw the bears&mdash;great big
bears and middle sized bears and little bit o&#8217;
bears just like in the story book, and she fed
them peanuts which they caught very deftly
in their soft cushioned paws. But all the
rest, she really couldn&#8217;t remember in the
right order&mdash;there were kangaroos and buffaloes
and a giraffe who stuck his long neck
over the top of a great high fence and made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
Mary Jane think of nothing so much as a
funny paper picture. And then of course
the monkeys&mdash;dozens of them and queer
birds with curious colored feathers and
funny bills and feet. Really, she had seen
in that one afternoon, more animals than she
had guessed lived in the whole world, oh,
many more!</p>
<p>&#8220;But have you seen the seals?&#8221; asked Mr.
Merrill who met them at the bird house.</p>
<p>No, they hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost four o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill,
looking at his watch, &#8220;and Mr. Holden
said they ate at four and we should meet him
there, so let&#8217;s hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a good thing they did hurry for
other folks seemed to know, too, that the
seals were fed at four. From all directions,
folks could be seen walking toward the big
enclosed pond where the seals were kept.
But, by hurrying, they got there in time to
stand close to the iron fence where they
could see the antics of those queerest of animals,
the seals.</p>
<p>One would suppose that even the seals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
knew it was nearly four o&#8217;clock, dinner time,
for they were so excited and eager. They
barked and swam and flung themselves
around vigorously as though they could
hardly stand waiting for anything. Then,
just at four, a man came out of a near-by
building. In his hand he carried a basket
of fish&mdash;a great, well-filled basket. He
came over to a little platform close by where
the Merrill and Holden children were standing;
so they could see everything.</p>
<p>He picked up a big fish, tossed it over into
the rocky island in the middle of the seals&#8217;
pond and then! such a scrambling as there
was till the middle-sized seal with a few ungainly
flops, grabbed the fish and gulped it
down in one bite.</p>
<p>Then he threw another fish and another
and another&mdash;one after the other so fast that
Mary Jane felt sure the seals must get all
mixed up about catching them. But they
didn&#8217;t. Those seals must have been smarter
than folks had thought for they seemed to
know, every time, just about where the fish
was to hit on the rocks and to know, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
just how to get to that particular spot the
quickest. Mary Jane thought it very wonderful.</p>
<p>But one thing worried her. There was
one small seal, who for some reason or other,
seemed to be always just a second too late to
get a fish. Mary Jane was sure he had had
but one and all the others had had, oh, a lot.
And she couldn&#8217;t help wishing all the others
wouldn&#8217;t be quite so grabby.</p>
<p>When the man who was feeding the seals
got almost to the bottom of his big basket,
he stopped and looked at the crowd of children
assembled for the feeding. And as
he looked, he spied Mary Jane&#8217;s sober little
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like to watch them?&#8221; he asked
her in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I like to only they&#8217;re so grabby,&#8221;
she replied promptly, &#8220;and he hasn&#8217;t had
but one.&#8221; She pointed out the little seal
who was a bit too slow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll fix that,&#8221; said the keeper, kindly,
&#8220;you just watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tossed a great big fish close to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
crowd of waiting seals, then, quick as a flash
and before they had had time to get that one,
he tossed another, straight at the little seal
who was on the edge of the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got it! He got it!&#8221; cried Mary
Jane happily, &#8220;he got it before they had a
chance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s going to get another,&#8221; said the
keeper as he threw another and still another,
straight at the hungry little seal. &#8220;There!&#8221;
he added as he looked at the now empty
basket, &#8220;that ought to do him till to-morrow.&#8221;
Mary Jane thought he looked so
comfortable now that surely he had had as
much as he needed for the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better hurry if we&#8217;re to see the lions
eat,&#8221; said Mr. Holden, who during the seals&#8217;
dining hour had come up behind his little
party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lions!&#8221; exclaimed Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, hurry up!&#8221; called Betty and she
and her brother who were quite familiar with
the park because of many previous visits,
ran on toward a big brick house near by.</p>
<p>Mary Jane wasn&#8217;t afraid, but all the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
she thought it would be more fun to hold
her father&#8217;s hand and even though they were
a bit behind, they got into the lions&#8217; house
in time.</p>
<p>Here the dinner was of meat, great big
chunks of raw, red meat that the keepers
tossed into the cages. And it was so funny
to watch! Just before the keeper appeared,
the lions and tigers and jackals and leopards
were pacing up and down their cages with
such weird roars and grunts and growls that
Mary Jane held tightly to her father&#8217;s hand
and didn&#8217;t go very close to the iron bars.
But when the keepers appeared with the
meat there was a wild scramble, and then
silence except for the crunching and smacking
of eating. It certainly was different, oh,
very, very different from anything Mary
Jane had ever seen before!</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not wait here any more,&#8221; suggested
Alice, &#8220;let&#8217;s show Dadah the monkeys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and the foxes&mdash;the white ones,&#8221;
said Mary Jane, &#8220;they&#8217;re my favorites of
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But before they had had time to show Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Merrill every single creature they had seen,
the Holden boys announced that they were
hungry and that it was long past dinner
time. And sure enough! Even though it
wasn&#8217;t really long <i>past</i> dinner time, it <i>was</i>
half past five&mdash;the time they had agreed
upon for dinner. So a very jolly party
seated themselves at a big round table on a
second story porch of the Park restaurant.
That was the nicest place to eat Mary Jane
had ever seen&mdash;unless perhaps a diner on a
train. For after they gave their order, she
discovered that they could look right down
on a small lake where ducks and geese and
swans lived. The children got so interested
watching the pretty creatures that for
once they didn&#8217;t have time to think the
waiter was slow!</p>
<p>They stayed there eating and watching
the birds, till the sun set back of the trees.
Then, when there wasn&#8217;t another scrap of
cake or teaspoonful of ice cream left, they
gathered up wraps and hats and started for
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know one thing,&#8221; said sleepy Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
Jane as they waited for the bus that was
to take them to their train. &#8220;I know
there&#8217;re a lot more animal folks in the world
than I thought for&mdash;oh, a lot more! And I
think I&#8217;d better come again to see them all.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
<h2>A DAY IN THE PARKS</h2>
</div>

<p>A whole long vacation begun! Alice
home all day and plenty of time for
walks and playing together! It seemed almost
too good to be true. For although
Alice was several years older than her sister
Mary Jane, the two girls had always had
very happy times playing together and they
had missed each other very much during
school days. Now that the Holden family
was away, for they went off, bag and baggage,
to their country home up in Wisconsin
the very day school closed, the two girls had
no one near by to play with, so more than
ever before they needed and enjoyed each
other&#8217;s company. Frances Westland had
gone back to the country and the Merrill
girls had not made friends with anyone who
lived near enough to make a convenient
playmate.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t do as some girls and boys do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
in vacation, get up late in the morning.
No, they thought it was more fun to get up
promptly and have breakfast with Dadah
and then, when the afternoon got hot, as
often happened, they took a nice long rest
and dressed fresh and clean for dinner. On
many a day Mrs. Merrill packed a basket of
dinner and they met Mr. Merrill over by the
park, had their dinner near one of the small
lagoons or close to the big lake. After dinner
they played ball or tennis&mdash;Alice was
learning to be very good at tennis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish there were swans in our park,&#8221;
said Mary Jane as she sat on the edge of
the lagoon and watched the row boats and
the electric launches gliding about on the
water. &#8220;I liked those swans at Lincoln
Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just thinking to-day,&#8221; said Mr.
Merrill, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t seen all the parks and
I promised you, that you should see them&mdash;all
the big ones anyway. I wonder when
we could go, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder <i>how</i> we could go,&#8221; said Mrs.
Merrill, &#8220;the parks are so far apart that a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
journey through them all would be a hopeless
task, seems to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depends on how you do it,&#8221; laughed Mr.
Merrill. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I thought.
I&#8217;ll take the whole day away from the office
so as to go along. We&#8217;ll start fairly early
and take the elevated out to Garfield Park&mdash;you
know we promised the girls a trip on
the elevated and we&#8217;ve always taken the
train! We&#8217;ll see that park well, you know
it has gardens and greenhouses and lakes,
and then we&#8217;ll get a taxi and go to two or
three other parks and ride home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls thought that was a wonderful
plan and they wanted to set the day for that
very same week. So Thursday was decided
upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now there&#8217;s one thing besides getting a
good lunch ready that I want you folks to
do,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill as they picked up their
baskets and balls ready to go home, &#8220;I want
you to get out that map of Chicago we had
on the train the day we came up here and
find just where Garfield Park is and how we
get there and how many interesting sights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
like rivers and parks and boulevards we pass
on the way.&#8221; And of course the girls
promised that they would find the map and
get all that information first thing in the
morning.</p>
<p>Riding on the elevated proved to be great
fun. Mary Jane was afraid for a few minutes
she wasn&#8217;t going to like it&mdash;the stairs
were so very high up with holes in each step
to see down to the ground; and the train
dashed to the platform with such a roar and
bustle and people crowded on and jerk! the
train rushed off. But when she settled
down in the seat, comfortingly near her
mother, and looked out over the roofs of
houses and stores, and down long streets,
one after another, she found she wasn&#8217;t a bit
afraid and that she liked it very much.
She liked watching for children on folks&#8217;
back porches. Some played on the porch
and some played in the dining-room windows&mdash;it
was easy to tell which were the
dining-room windows because always there
were three big windows and always she could
look right through the curtains and see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
big table in the middle of the room. The
only trouble with watching folks from an
elevated was that the train dashed by so
quickly she couldn&#8217;t any more than see, till&mdash;flash,
flash, and they were gone and there
was another street and another set of back
stairs and some different children playing.
It really was awfully queer.</p>
<p>Pretty soon they reached the big down
town and there they got off their train,
climbed over a big bridge to another elevated
train and away they went whizzing
again. It certainly was a queer way to
travel, Mary Jane thought.</p>
<p>But finally father announced that they
had come to Garfield Park, so they got off,
walked down the stairs to a park that looked
so much like their own park that Mary Jane
had to rub her eyes and look twice to make
sure she wasn&#8217;t dreaming. Here were the
same winding driveways, beautiful trees
and small lakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did we come back to our Park?&#8221; she
asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; answered Alice who had run on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
a little ahead, &#8220;look at the big greenhouse
and look back there! Now don&#8217;t you see
the swans?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it wasn&#8217;t their own neighborhood
park, Mary Jane soon realized that, because
there were many new things to be seen.
The wonderful tropical greenhouse where
palms and bananas and wonderful ferns
such as the girls had seen in Florida were
growing. And then there were beautiful
out of door gardens&mdash;Mary Jane liked those
even better than the greenhouse gardens,
wonderful as those were. She seemed to
feel, someway, as though the flowers must
like the out of doors better.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the many lovely
flower beds in the out of doors gardens, there
was a lily pool in which grew water lilies of
all colors and sorts. Mary Jane had never
seen water lilies before and she thought them
very lovely&mdash;and rather queer too, if the
truth must be told. She decided she would
stay right there a while and let Alice and
her father explore the rest of the gardens&mdash;they
wanted to know names of flowers and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
names didn&#8217;t seem a bit interesting to the
little girl.</p>
<p>Just after she had decided to stay there
and play, she spied a boy of about her age
who was watching the lilies too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you walk all the way around the
edge?&#8221; he asked her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Edge of what?&#8221; asked Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;The edge of the pool,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;see,&#8221; and he put his foot up on the stone
rim of the pool, &#8220;all the way around on
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you?&#8221; asked Mary Jane. She
wanted to see what he would say before she
answered his question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; he replied, &#8220;it&#8217;s just as easy!
Only girls are &#8217;fraidies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m not,&#8221; declared Mary Jane
firmly, &#8220;watch!&#8221; She stepped up on the
stone rim&mdash;it was about eight inches wide&mdash;and
walked boldly along toward the middle
of the long side of the pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can, can&#8217;t you,&#8221; said the boy admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as easy,&#8221; replied Mary Jane, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
when she found she could do what he had
asked she was anxious to have it appear to
be as easy for her as for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; the boy suggested, &#8220;let&#8217;s
race!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Race?&#8221; asked Mary Jane, &#8220;how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Round the pool. You start this way,
and I&#8217;ll start that way and the one that gets
around home first beats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Mary Jane, &#8220;let&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now before Mary Jane saw the boy by the
pool, Mrs. Merrill spied some very beautiful
grasses over at one side of the gardens;
the very sort of grasses, she decided,
that Mary Jane&#8217;s grandmother would like to
use in her flower beds by the driveways.
And of course she wanted to find out the
names of the grasses so she could write to
grandmother about them. Seeing that
Mary Jane was so absorbed in the pool and
the lilies, she slipped over to look at the
name sign which she knew would be stuck
right by the roots. She jotted the name
down in her note book, looked along at a
few others and&mdash;turned back to the pool just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
in time to see her small daughter and a
strange boy run racingly along the rim of
the pool straight at each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Jane! Mary Jane!&#8221; she called,
&#8220;jump down onto the ground! Jump
down!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether Mary Jane heard her and became
confused, or whether the boy&#8217;s bumping
into her made her lose her balance, nobody
ever quite found out. But anyway,
right before Mrs. Merrill&#8217;s astonished eyes,
Mary Jane Merrill tumbled &#8217;kplump&mdash;into
the lily pool!</p>
<p>Fortunately the lily pool wasn&#8217;t very deep
so Mary Jane didn&#8217;t fall far. But she did
hit the bottom pretty hard; so hard that
when she bobbed up, her head out of water
and her feet on the bottom, she hardly knew
what had happened to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill screamed and Mr. Merrill,
Alice, three policemen and about twenty
other people came running to see what had
happened. It wasn&#8217;t necessary for anybody
to jump in and make a triumphant rescue for
Mary Jane was so close to shore that Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
Merrill had taken firm hold of her hand and
pulled her out just as all the folks got there.
So there was nothing for them to do but to
stare and to ask questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did she do it?&#8221; asked the first
policeman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt you any?&#8221; asked the second.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and your mother come with me,&#8221;
said the third (and Mary Jane guessed right
away from his voice that he must have some
little girls of his own), &#8220;and I&#8217;ll show you
where you can dry your clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The procession of policemen and onlookers,
led by a very wet and greatly embarrassed
little girl, crossed the gardens, crossed
the street and went into a comfortable big
building. There a kindly matron produced
a big bathrobe in which Mary Jane sat while
her dress was wrung out and dried. And
wasn&#8217;t she glad there was a good hot sun so
things could dry quickly!</p>
<p>Finally, when Mary Jane was beginning
to get awfully hungry, mother announced
that the clothes were dry and that she had
pulled and stretched them the best she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
in the place of ironing. So Mary Jane
dressed and they went in search of Alice and
her father.</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, you certainly do mix up baths with
your picnics,&#8221; laughed Mr. Merrill when he
saw them coming. &#8220;Remember the time
you fell into Clearwater, Pussy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t so bad, really, Dadah,&#8221; said
Mary Jane, &#8220;and I&#8217;m not wet now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill, &#8220;but <i>I</i>
am hungry&mdash;anybody agree with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>They all admitted to being nearly starved,
so they found a pretty, grassy spot close by
the lake on which several beautiful swans
were sunning themselves, and there they
spread out the luncheon they had brought.
At first the girls were so hungry they didn&#8217;t
want to do anything but eat. But by the
time they had eaten a plateful of potato
salad and three or four sandwiches, the
swans discovered their lunching place and
came to call. Evidently swans were used
to being treated very nicely by folks who
came to the park for they didn&#8217;t seem to have
a trace of fear of strangers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>The girls tossed the crusts of the sandwiches
to the edge of the water and the
swans bent their long necks and picked them
up and ate them, every crust, so daintily
just as though crusts were a diet fit for kings&mdash;and
swans. The swans didn&#8217;t actually
come out of the water, but they came so close
to the shore that the girls could almost touch
them and they soon got to feeling very well
acquainted.</p>
<p>So it was with some regret that they heard
Mr. Merrill say, &#8220;Well, girls, weren&#8217;t we
to see some of the other parks too?&#8221; And
here it was four o&#8217;clock!</p>
<p>The basket was packed&mdash;and there wasn&#8217;t
a scrap of anything a swan could eat, you
may be sure of that&mdash;and they strolled down
to the roadway. In a minute or two Mr.
Merrill hailed a passing taxi and they settled
themselves for a nice long ride.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t stop at any other park; Mary
Jane was sure no other could be as interesting
as the one where she had had such exciting
experiences and Alice was quite as content
as her father and mother to sit back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
cool and comfortable, and see the beautiful
flowers and shrubbery slip past them. So
they rode and rode through one park after
another, it seemed, till suddenly Mary Jane
spied something that looked familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my Midway!&#8221; she announced, as
the car turned into the long, broad stretch of
parkway near their own home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough it is!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Merrill
in pretended amazement, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to
turn around and go back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No we won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mary Jane, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they went on home, just in time to cook
a good warm dinner and to talk over and
over again the many things they had seen in
the parks.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
<h2>VISITORS&mdash;AND A BOAT RIDE</h2>
</div>

<p>One day, not so very long after the
trip through the parks, the bell at the
Merrills&#8217; front door pealed long and hard.
Mary Jane, whose job was answering the
door, ran to the little house &#8217;phone, and
heard a loud voice shout, &#8220;Special for Merrill!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he mean, mother?&#8221; she asked, in
a puzzled voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better press the buzzer and let him in,
dear,&#8221; replied Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;if he has the
name right he must have something for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Mary Jane pressed the downstairs buzzer
and then opened the front door. Yes,
it was for them&mdash;a special delivery letter
for Mrs. Merrill. Mary Jane and Alice
were much excited and could hardly wait
till the messenger&#8217;s book was signed and the
letter was opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from grandma,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
she glanced at the writing, &#8220;and listen!
This is what she says:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Grandpa finds quite unexpectedly that
he must come to Chicago on business and he
says that if it&#8217;s convenient to you folks I
can come along and we&#8217;ll stay two or three
days for a visit. Please wire reply because
we must start Wednesday evening.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s ten o&#8217;clock Wednesday morning
now!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Merrill. She
hurried to the telephone, called Mr. Merrill
so he could send a telegram at once, then she
and the two girls went right to work making
ready for the guests.</p>
<p>It was decided that Alice and Mary Jane
should sleep on couches and give up their
room to the visitors. &#8220;Now&#8217;s when I wish
we had our nice guest room,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill,
&#8220;but then, grandma knows that folks
who live in Chicago flats don&#8217;t keep guest
rooms for infrequent visitors.&#8221; For her
part, Mary Jane thought sleeping on a couch
would be great fun&mdash;so grown up and different
from every day. She was to have the
dining-room couch and Alice was to sleep in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
the living-room. When all plans were
made, bedding sorted out and laid ready for
making up the beds fresh first thing in the
morning, Mrs. Merrill began planning the
meals. If the visitors were to stay only a
short time she wanted to have as much baking
and marketing as possible done beforehand,
so every minute could be spent in fun and
visiting. Alice and Mary Jane, who had
been marketing so much with their mother of
late that they really could be trusted, took a
long list up to the grocery and Mrs. Merrill
set to work baking coffeecake and bread and
cookies. Um-m! It wasn&#8217;t an hour till
that tiny kitchen began to smell so good that
the girls could hardly be coaxed away.
Mrs. Merrill let them help in a good many
ways. Mary Jane put the sugar and nuts
on the tops of the cookies after her mother
put them in the pan and Alice, who was getting
to be a really good cook, tended to the
baking. She put the big pans in, and
watched the baking, and took them out when
every cookie was evenly browned. Then,
after she took a pan out of the oven, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
gently lifted the hot cookies out from the
baking pan onto a wire rack where they
could cool without losing their pretty
shapes. When the cookies were cool, it was
Mary Jane&#8217;s turn again. She put them all
in the tin cookie box, counting them and
laying them neatly between layers of paraffin
paper so they would keep fresh even in
the hot weather.</p>
<p>It was a rule that only perfect cookies
should be packed away&mdash;scraps never went
into the tin box. But for some reason or
other, the girls never seemed to mind the job
of eating the broken ones! In fact Mary
Jane often asked Alice <i>not</i> to be so careful&mdash;to
please break a few so there would be
plenty to eat right then and there.</p>
<p>The day went by so quickly that it was
bed time before the girls realized it and then,
after about forty winks, it was morning&mdash;the
morning when grandma and grandpa
were coming.</p>
<p>Everybody was up early, Alice and Mary
Jane made up the beds fresh and neat,
mother cooked a good breakfast and Dadah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
went to the train, at a near-by suburban
station, to meet the travelers. It was a
jolly party that sat around the breakfast
table&mdash;you may be sure of that!</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill, when the
breakfast was eaten up and news of the farm
had been told, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go to work and I
suppose grandpa has to do his business to-day,
so we&#8217;ll leave you folks to yourselves.
Then to-morrow, if grandpa is through his
business, we can plan some fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the two business folks went down town
and grandma was left to enjoy life at home.
The girls were glad she could stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take grandma over to the lake,&#8221;
suggested Alice, &#8220;I know you&#8217;d love riding
in one of those little electric launches,
grandmother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take some lunch and not come home
till she&#8217;s seen everything in Chicago,&#8221; said
Mary Jane in a rush of hospitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! Child!&#8221; exclaimed grandma
in dismay, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know there&#8217;s another
day coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane agreed to leave a few sights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
for the next day, but she didn&#8217;t want to lose
any time getting off. Fortunately the
morning work didn&#8217;t take but a tiny bit of
time, and as grandma, who didn&#8217;t care much
for &#8220;stuffy sleepers,&#8221; was very glad to get
out into the fresh air, they very soon were
on their way to the park.</p>
<p>The girls felt quite at home in the neighborhood
and in the park by this time, and
they thought it was great fun to show the
sights to somebody else&mdash;somebody who
didn&#8217;t know all about Chicago. Grandma
loved the beautiful Midway, the charming
lagoons and she enjoyed her ride on the little
launch fully as much as the girls had
thought she would.</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you have any <i>big</i> boats?&#8221; she
asked, &#8220;great big ones with two decks and
lots of passengers and all that? I&#8217;d like
to ride on a big boat too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ll do to-morrow,
mother,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill.
&#8220;There is a big boat that runs from Jackson
Park up to the municipal pier. We&#8217;ll go on
it to-morrow and we&#8217;ll get our lunch up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
town and then we&#8217;ll come back home on the
boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what they did.</p>
<p>When Mr. Merrill heard that grandma
wanted a ride on a big boat, the plans for the
next day were as good as made. He thought
the idea of going to town on the boat and
then getting lunch and coming home was a
fine one and he only made one change in
the plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of going to a store, in the loop,
let&#8217;s take one of the little launches that run
from the Municipal pier to Lincoln Park
and go up there for our lunch so grandma can
see your favorite swans and perhaps, if we
want to stay that long, see the seals get their
four o&#8217;clock tea.&#8221; But dear me, he little
guessed what would happen as his nice-sounding
plan worked out!</p>
<p>So the next morning, the Merrills all
had a nice, leisurely, visity breakfast, then
a walk through the park, and never did the
park look lovelier than on the sunny summer
morning, and then, boarding the boat
that rocked at the pier on the big lake, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
found comfortable seats on the shady side
and prepared for a pleasant ride.</p>
<p>Mary Jane chose to sit on the side nearest
the pier because she loved to look down
from the upper deck and watch the people
boarding the boat. She had never ridden
on boats very much, only when she went to
Florida, and this boat they were now aboard
seemed very different from the big, awkward,
flat bottomed boat they took their
river trip on through Florida jungles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to sit by me if you want
to talk to mother,&#8221; she said to her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said her father teasingly,
&#8220;how do I know you&#8217;re not going to tumble
overboard! You know you have a way of
mixing up picnics and water, Mary Jane, so
I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll take any chances.&#8221; But
when Mary Jane promised that she would
sit very still and not walk around a step and
not lean over the edge, he went to speak to
grandpa a few minutes. And while he was
gone, Mary Jane leaned up against the side
of the boat and watched the folks down on
the pier.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>She thought it must surely be about time
for the boat to start because there was hurrying
on the pier, and men were busy taking
ropes off of the big wooden posts along the
side nearest the water. While she was
watching, a woman came along the dock toward
the boat and with her were two little
children, a girl about Mary Jane&#8217;s own age
and a little boy some two years younger.
Just as they reached the gang plank, ready
to step onto the boat, the little boy began to
cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I left my boat! I left my boat! I left
my boat!&#8221; he cried. Mary Jane could hear
him very plainly even though she sat so far
up above him.</p>
<p>She couldn&#8217;t hear what the mother said,
but evidently she promised to get the missing
boat for him, because she left both children
by the side of the gang plank, and
hurrying as fast as possible she ran back toward
the shore. And right at that minute,
the big bell overhead rang three times and
the engine aboard the boat began to throb&mdash;it
was time to go.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>The men on the dock noticed the two children
and one said to the little girl, &#8220;Were
you going?&#8221; and she nodded yes. So he
picked up the boy and hurried the two children
aboard just as the gang plank was
hauled in and the boat made away from the
pier.</p>
<p>Mary Jane was so thrilled and excited she
could hardly sit still. She tried to call her
father but he was on the other side of the
boat and she had promised to sit still&mdash;perfectly
still&mdash;till he came back. What in
the world was a little girl to do? And back
on the shore that was so rapidly getting farther
and farther way, Mary Jane could see
the mother of the children, running frantically
toward the dock which the boat had
left. Surely the captain would see her,
Mary Jane thought. But if he did, he likely
thought she was merely somebody who had
missed the boat and that he had no time for
turning back. And so the boat continued
out into the lake.</p>
<p>Finally after what seemed the <i>longest</i>
time (though it really was hardly more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
five minutes), Mr. Merrill came back and
then, such a story as he heard!</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure, Mary Jane?&#8221; he asked,
&#8220;certain sure? The men wouldn&#8217;t put children
on a boat without grown folks along!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they did, Dadah!&#8221; insisted Mary
Jane, &#8220;I saw &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you come with me,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill,
&#8220;and we&#8217;ll see if we can find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Mr. Merrill and Mary Jane went
down the stairs, and that took some time
because folks were coming and going and
getting settled for the trip, and there, huddled
close together and crying as hard as
they could cry, were the two little waifs!</p>
<p>Mary Jane with real motherliness began
talking to the little girl; Mr. Merrill picked
up the boy and together the whole party
went in search of the captain. By the time
he was found though, the boat was still farther
on its journey toward the city and the
dock they started from was farther and farther
behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is a time we were wrong,&#8221; admitted
the captain when he had listened to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
all Mary Jane had to say and talked with
the man who had put the children aboard.
&#8220;But even though we were wrong, we can&#8217;t
go back now. We&#8217;ll have to make the children
comfortable and take them back to their
mother on the return trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Mr. Merrill and Mary Jane went back
to the deck, only this time they took with
them the two little strangers. Mrs. Merrill
was told the story and she and Alice and
Mary Jane, with help from grandma,
grandpa and Mr. Merrill, set themselves to
the task of making the little children happy.
At first it was hard work, because they cried
all the time for their mother. But erelong
they understood the friendliness around
them and they stopped crying and began to
have a good time. Grandpa discovered
some crackerjack and everybody knows what
a help <i>that</i> is; Mrs. Merrill told some funny
stories and Mr. Merrill took them all over
the boat&mdash;to see the great engine and everything.
Then there were the sights to watch
from the deck and the big buildings to count
and the boats they passed to watch&mdash;oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
there surely was a lot to do that made that
trip interesting and so very short.</p>
<p>As the boat pulled up near the down town
pier, the Merrills saw a taxi dash up near
where the boat was to land: saw a woman
get out and, followed by a policeman, hurry
up to the side where the boat would pull
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; exclaimed Mary Jane excitedly.
&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girl, whose name was Ann,
looked along with the others, and then she
gave a happy cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; she shouted, so loudly that
her mother, waiting on the pier could hear
and was so very relieved!</p>
<p>When the boat pulled into the dock, the
captain was the first one to step off; he met
the mother and the officer and brought them
aboard at once. Mary Jane was called upon
to explain all that she had seen and the officer,
as well as the mother, was satisfied that
the whole thing was an accident and not an
attempt to steal the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you get up here so quickly?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
asked Mary Jane, when the first excitement
was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child!&#8221; laughed Ann&#8217;s mother,
&#8220;a person can do a lot when she thinks something
is happening to her children! I took
a passing taxi, dashed to a police station
and then on up here. And nothing has happened
at all&mdash;except you nice people have
given my little folks a very pleasant trip.
Next time, Bobby,&#8221; she added, &#8220;we&#8217;ll leave
your toy boat or we&#8217;ll all go together to find
it. We won&#8217;t take any chances of losing
each other!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Mr. Merrill when the
mother and children and officer and captain
had all gone on about their own business,
&#8220;what was it we were going to do to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed at that! They had
been so excited that they had forgotten, yes,
actually forgotten, that this was a sight-seeing
trip for grandma and grandpa. But
once they remembered, they knew just what
to do. They climbed aboard a waiting
launch, rode up to Lincoln Park, had a wonderful
dinner and fun all the rest of the day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; remarked grandma, as they
neared home, late that evening, &#8220;how you
girls are ever going to settle down to school
again! Did you know that school was only
a few weeks away? Vacation will be over
before you know it!&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
<h2>SCHOOL BEGINS</h2>
</div>

<p>When grandma suggested that it
was nearly time for school to begin,
on that day of the boat ride, she guessed
better than the girls suspected. At the
time they laughed and thought she was joking,
but, after she and grandpa had gone
home, they got out a calendar and counted
up and there, to be sure, only one and one-half
weeks of vacation were left.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize school began so early,&#8221;
exclaimed Mrs. Merrill in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought summer was a long time!&#8221;
cried Alice, &#8220;but it isn&#8217;t any time at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goody! Goody! Goody!&#8221; Mary Jane
said happily, &#8220;then I get to start to school
like a big girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was no wonder Mary Jane was happy,
for she remembered that the plan was for
her to start in the really truly school, not the
kindergarten where she had gone in her other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
home, and any little girl likes to start to
school like her big sister.</p>
<p>When the day finally came, Alice was as
much excited as Mary Jane herself. For
although the summer had been so pleasant
she almost hated to see it end&mdash;the free days
with plenty of time for visits with mother
and picnics and marketing and all&mdash;still,
school was pleasant too and any little girl
who does nice work and tries to learn, will
make good friends and have happy days, just
as Alice always had had.</p>
<p>Mary Jane had a hard time deciding
which dress to wear. She wanted to look
very grown up, so that teacher would realize
she was a big girl, so she finally decided
upon a dark blue sailor suit. The one that
had the red insignia on the sleeve and that
looked just like a big girl&#8217;s dress. With a
clean &#8217;kerchief peeking out of her pocket
and a smashing big red bow on the top of her
brown head, she looked very nice.</p>
<p>Alice and Mary Jane waked up that
morning the very minute they were called
for they wanted to help mother so she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
go over to school with them. And with all
that good help of course they were off on
time. Alice was glad to have company going
to school for Frances wasn&#8217;t home yet
and wouldn&#8217;t be there for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Mary Jane&#8217;s heart went thump, thump as
she and her mother went in at the teachers&#8217;
gate, and up the stairs and into the principal&#8217;s
office. And thump, thump some more
when she saw the whole roomful of strange
boys and girls and thump, thump some more
when her turn came and she was sent (fortunately
with her mother along) to the first
grade room&mdash;number 104. The room was
full of children, hundreds, Mary Jane
thought there must be, though the teacher
told Mrs. Merrill there were about forty-five.
And if her heart went thump, thump
before, it certainly went thump, thump,
<i>thump</i> when the teacher, smiling at her so
kindly, gave her a seat in the&mdash;front-row&mdash;such
a nice seat for her very own! and
she sat down and tried to look as though she
had been used to going to school all her
whole life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>For a minute she couldn&#8217;t look around
or anything, she felt so queer. Then she
glanced at the next seat and there, sitting
right beside her, was&mdash;whom do you suppose?
Ann! The same pretty little Ann
who had been lost on the boat. Immediately
Mary Jane forgot all about being
afraid and thumping hearts and strangeness
and everything and began to like school.
The two little girls had much to say about
what they would do at recess and where did
they live and everything, so the time before
school began passed very quickly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the midst of their talk, a
bell rang, &#8220;GONG-GONG!&#8221; Two loud
tones close together that way, and school
began. Mary Jane Merrill was in a really
truly school like the big girl she was getting
to be.</p>
<p>Ann came home with Mary Jane that first
afternoon and Mrs. Merrill discovered that
her name was Ann Ellis and that she lived
two blocks from their own home and that
the two little girls would no doubt find it
very easy to be friends. They began having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
a good time that very afternoon and they
planned still better times when Betty would
be back and they could all play together.
Now wasn&#8217;t that fine!</p>
<p>Mary Jane found that she liked school
every bit as much as she had thought she
would. She liked her teacher, a charming
Miss Treavor, and she liked her studies.
But most of all she liked the fun she had on
the playground. In the big cities, like Chicago,
where lots of girls and boys have no
yards, the school yards are the only places
were children can play. So, to make everything
safe and orderly, the school folks have
a playground teacher stay at school all the
day, to help in the games and to see that
every one has a happy time. The playground
teacher at Mary Jane&#8217;s school liked
little girls very much and she knew many
good games for them to play. So in addition
to &#8220;London Bridge&#8221; and &#8220;Drop the
Handkerchief&#8221; and &#8220;Tag&#8221; that all children
play, Mary Jane learned &#8220;Roman Soldiers&#8221;
and &#8220;Ghost Walk&#8221; and &#8220;Three times
Three.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>Of the new ones, Mary Jane liked &#8220;Ghost
Walk&#8221; the best. To play it, the girls and
boys made a big circle, then they selected
some one to be &#8220;Ghost.&#8221; This person stood
in the middle of the circle and everybody
shut eyes tight, very tight. Then the
Ghost, while every one kept very quiet, tried
to tip-toe to the edge of the circle, slip out
between two folks and get away without being
caught. That may sound easy, but
played in a yard full of romping boys and
girls, it is not really as easy as it might seem
and it was lots of fun, because often folks
would think the &#8220;Ghost&#8221; was near them and
would try to grab&mdash;and the joke was on them
because all the while, maybe, the &#8220;ghost&#8221;
was in another part of the ring. And
whenever folks thought they caught the
&#8220;Ghost&#8221; and <i>didn&#8217;t</i>, then every one opened
their eyes, the person who had made the mistake
had to get out of the circle and the
game began again. But if the &#8220;Ghost&#8221;
really did get out of the circle without being
caught, then the &#8220;Ghost&#8221; could hide
anywhere in the yard and the game became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
an old-fashioned hide-and-seek with everybody
hunting one lucky person.</p>
<p>One day, when Mary Jane was &#8220;Ghost,&#8221;
she was determined she would get out of
that circle without getting caught. She
had tried it many a time before and failed;
this time she was going to do it. She tiptoed,
oh, so softly over the loose gravel to
the edge of the circle. Then noiselessly she
dropped down on hands and knees and, without
a thought for her dress, crawled slowly
between Ann and the girl next to her. She
could hardly keep from giggling, it was so
funny to be so close she almost bumped them
and yet not to be discovered. Now she was
right between them, now she was almost
outside&mdash;now she was free and away she
dashed to the spot she had long ago picked
out as a hiding place for just such a time as
this.</p>
<p>The folks in the circle waited&mdash;but nobody
was caught, so they shouted, &#8220;Ghost
Walk?&#8221; and when the &#8220;ghost&#8221; didn&#8217;t answer
they opened their eyes and&mdash;no Mary
Jane was there!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get her,&#8221; shouted Ann, &#8220;I&#8217;ll find
her! I&#8217;ll bet she got out on your side of
the circle, Janny, she never could have
passed <i>me</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find her myself,&#8221; answered Janny,
&#8220;but she never passed by me, she didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>So they hunted, up and down the yard,
around the bushes, by the doorway, everywhere
they could think of. But no sign of
Mary Jane did they discover. They hunted
and they hunted till the gong sounded and
they had to go into school again. But not
a sign of any Mary Jane did they find.
Was Mary Jane lost? Miss Treavor must
be told so everybody could hunt, for something
surely must have happened to a little
girl who didn&#8217;t answer the recess bell when
it rang for school to begin.</p>
<p>Now it happened that some days before,
when Mary Jane had first learned to play
&#8220;Ghost walk&#8221; she hunted around the yard
for a good place to hide&mdash;in case she ever
succeeded in getting out of the circle so she
<i>could</i> hide. She didn&#8217;t want to hide among
the bushes because that was the first place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
the children looked; she didn&#8217;t want to hide
in the doorway because that was against
rules and if a child was discovered there by
a teacher, the child had to go straight upstairs
and stay the rest of recess. And there
didn&#8217;t seem to be any other place. But
there was another hiding place&mdash;and Mary
Jane found it. Around the corner of the
building, on the side nearest the furnace entrance,
there was a jog in the brick wall.
And in front of the little niche made by this
jog, boards left by some carpenters had been
carelessly tossed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could climb over the boards,&#8221; Mary
Jane had thought, &#8220;and hide down behind
and nobody&#8217;d ever find me&mdash;ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when her time came, and she really did
get out of the circle without being caught,
she didn&#8217;t have to stop and hunt a hiding
place; she knew exactly where she wanted
to go.</p>
<p>But there was one thing Mary Jane hadn&#8217;t
figured on; one thing she didn&#8217;t even think
of as she crouched down behind her boards
while the children hunted for her, hither and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
yon over the school yard. She hadn&#8217;t
thought that way off, &#8217;round the corner and
behind boards that way, she couldn&#8217;t&mdash;<i>hear</i>.
The sounds of playing and romping seemed
so quiet, so quiet that they were hardly noticeable.
She didn&#8217;t hear the bell and she
didn&#8217;t even notice the sudden quiet when the
children fell in line to march upstairs. She
sat there, huddled in a snug little heap, and
she laughed to herself about the joke she was
playing on her mates.</p>
<p>To be sure the time <i>did</i> seem pretty long
and she thought they were very stupid&mdash;but
then&mdash;she never suspected that recess
was over and&mdash;</p>
<p>Till suddenly there descended upon her
a cloud of chalk dust! It powdered her
face and dress and shoes and made her forget
all about being quiet and jump up with
a lively scream of fright.</p>
<p>Overhead she heard Miss Treavor&#8217;s voice,
exclaiming, &#8220;Whatever in the world!&#8221;
And then, before she could quite get the dust
out of her eyes and understand what had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
happened, Miss Treavor and two other
teachers who had heard the scream, stood before
her and the whole story came out.
Miss Treavor tried not to laugh when Mary
Jane told her she was hiding but she couldn&#8217;t
help it. Mary Jane looked so be-powdered
and forlorn. But Mary Jane didn&#8217;t mind
the laughing because at the same time, Miss
Treavor lifted her out from behind the
boards and set her down in the cheerful sunlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;That <i>was</i> a good place to hide,&#8221; the
teacher admitted, &#8220;and you were a clever
little girl to think of it. But I believe,
dear,&#8221; she added kindly, &#8220;that next time
you&#8217;d better hide some place where you can
hear the bell, even though you <i>are</i> more
likely to get caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Mary Jane promised that she would
never, never hide in such a very good place
again.</p>
<p>Mary Jane hated to go back into the
school room all mussed and tumbled as she
was, so Miss Treavor sent for Alice and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
two little girls skipped home for a fresh dress
and clean ribbons so Mary Jane could enjoy
the classes.</p>
<p>When, a half an hour later, she came back,
with the dark blue dress changed to a plaid
gingham and the red bow changed to green,
the children wanted to know where she had
been and what had happened. But Miss
Treavor wouldn&#8217;t tell. And she had made
Mary Jane promise not to tell, because that
place was <i>such</i> a good hiding place that the
teachers didn&#8217;t want other folks finding it
and hiding there to make trouble too.</p>
<p>But all of Mary Jane&#8217;s school fun wasn&#8217;t
from trouble. That was just one day.
Most of the time, she played without
anything happening just as the other folks
did. And all the time she made more
friends and had a better time, till, when
Betty came back from the country, she knew
most everybody in her room.</p>
<p>She liked school so very much that the
days slipped by one after another so fast a
person could hardly count them&mdash;one day
and another day and another day&mdash;just that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
way. Till one Monday morning when they
went to school, Miss Treavor announced,
&#8220;Do you boys and girls know what we are
going to do to-day? We&#8217;re going to start
making Christmas presents. Because
Christmas is only <i>three weeks away</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christmas!&#8221; thought Mary Jane, with a
thrill of joy, &#8220;Christmas! Why, they <i>do</i>
have Christmas in Chicago! I wonder what
I&#8217;ll get and what I&#8217;ll do!&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
<h2>CHRISTMAS IN CHICAGO</h2>
</div>

<p>Christmas in Chicago! When
Mary Jane heard those words she had
her first real pang of homesickness for the
home she had left when they moved to Chicago.
Would any Christmas anywhere ever
be so beautiful as the Christmas in that dear
home? She remembered the pine trees in
the yard, loaded down with their wealth of
snow: the glowing fire on the hearth with its
Christmas-y smell from the pine cones that
were saved through the year for the Christmas
Day fire; the tree in the angle near the
fireplace where the afternoon sun touched
it into a blaze of glory; the party for the
poor children that had been such fun to plan
for&mdash;would anything in Chicago ever be
half the fun of Christmas in the old home?
But Mary Jane was soon to discover that
Christmas doesn&#8217;t need certain houses or
fires or trees to make it perfect; that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
Christmas is made in folks&#8217; hearts and that
wherever there is a Christmas heart, there
will be a happy day&mdash;in village or city, the
place makes no difference.</p>
<p>When she went home from school that
afternoon and announced that Miss Treavor
said Christmas was so very near, she found
that mother wasn&#8217;t even a little surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why to be sure Christmas is coming,&#8221;
laughed Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;and here I&#8217;ve been
waiting and waiting and <i>waiting</i> for you to
talk about it till, actually, I thought I&#8217;d had
to begin myself, if you didn&#8217;t wake up pretty
soon.&#8221; And then everybody began to talk
at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they have trees in Chicago?&#8221; asked
Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there any poor folks who would like
parties?&#8221; asked Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anybody coming to see us?&#8221; demanded
Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! Here! Here!&#8221; exclaimed Mr.
Merrill, &#8220;one at a time, ladies, one at a
time! If you doubt that there will be trees
in Chicago, you should see what I saw this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
morning as I went down to work. A train
load of Christmas trees&mdash;yes, sir!&#8221; (for he
noticed the girls could hardly believe him)
&#8220;a whole train load of trees. And I see by
the paper this evening that a boat load has
arrived, too, so there will be no shortage of
trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we can have one,&#8221; said Mary Jane,
with a satisfied sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;And let&#8217;s put it in front of this foolish
little gas log,&#8221; suggested Alice, &#8220;then
we won&#8217;t think about a real fireplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there are plenty of poor folks,&#8221; said
Mrs. Merrill, going back to Mary Jane&#8217;s
question, &#8220;only they will not be so easy to
get together, as back at home. How would
you like to take a Christmas party to some
family instead of having a party at home as
we did last year?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls hardly knew what to say about
that new idea so Mrs. Merrill explained further.
&#8220;I telephoned to the Associated
Charities this very day,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and they
gave me the names of a fatherless family
in which there are two girls about your ages,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
and one boy. I thought we could plan a
fine Christmas for them and then, on Christmas
morning, take it over and surprise
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s do that, mother,&#8221; said Mary
Jane happily, &#8220;then we&#8217;d be like a real Santa
Claus only we&#8217;d be a morning Santa. May
we do it, surely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d like the idea,&#8221; said Mrs.
Merrill, &#8220;so I got lists from the association
as to just what was most needed. Alice, if
you&#8217;ll get a pencil and paper, we&#8217;ll figure
it all out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making plans was the girls&#8217; favorite way
of spending an evening so they whisked the
cover off the dining table, pulled up chairs
for four and went to work list-making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; began Mrs. Merrill, consulting
her list, &#8220;hasn&#8217;t a bit of warm clothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t I knit him a muffler and
some mittens?&#8221; asked Mary Jane. &#8220;I remember
how and I haven&#8217;t knitted anything
since the war stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; approved Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;I think
I have enough yarn for the mittens and if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
you&#8217;ll get it out of the drawer there we can
wind it while we talk and it will be all ready
for you to set up at once. You&#8217;ll have to
work hard and fast if you want to make a
muffler and a pair of mittens before Christmas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; she continued, looking at the
list, &#8220;they have very few bed covers and the
children get so cold at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t you make some covers,
mother?&#8221; suggested Alice, &#8220;and let me make
them each some flannelette pajamas like we
wear&mdash;you know how toasting warm they
are. And I have the pattern and I know I
could make them all myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a beautiful idea,&#8221; approved Mrs.
Merrill, &#8220;and I hadn&#8217;t even thought of such
a thing. When we get through planning,
dear, you can get out your pattern and see
how much material you&#8217;ll need. Then,
when I go up town to-morrow, I&#8217;ll get it for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they need stockings,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;and shoes&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could any of &#8217;em wear my good shoes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
that are too little?&#8221; asked Mary Jane eagerly.
She had been greatly distressed about
those &#8220;best&#8221; shoes that were so good, and
yet were hopelessly outgrown.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;ll be exactly right,&#8221; said
Mrs. Merrill. &#8220;In fact I picked out this
particular family because I was sure we
could find nice things for them among you
girls&#8217; outgrown things and that, put with
what we buy new, would make all the bigger
Christmas for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And about toys,&#8221; she continued with the
list, &#8220;the girls have never had a doll&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never had&mdash;&#8221; began Mary Jane but she
couldn&#8217;t quite get the words out. Never
had a doll. Never had a Marie Georgiannamore
to love and care for and take riding
in a beautiful cart. Never had&mdash;no,
she couldn&#8217;t quite imagine it.</p>
<p>After that there was no more reading off
a list. Mary Jane and Alice began making
a list of their own, of what those children
were to have for Christmas.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; objected Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;you girls
forget that things cost money&mdash;a lot of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
money these days. And you can&#8217;t possibly
buy all those things and get any Christmas
of your own too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted Mary Jane as she
squeezed her face up tight in an effort to
write, &#8220;then we won&#8217;t have one of our own!
Haven&#8217;t we got Marie Georgiannamore and
a cart and a nice house and warm clothes&mdash;and&mdash;everything?&#8221;</p>
<p>That settled it. There would be a tree
and dinner and a lot of fun in the Merrill
house on Christmas Day, but the presents
were to go to their adopted family to make
<i>their</i> Christmas one never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>If you have ever planned a Christmas for
somebody who never, in all their lives had
one, you will know something about the fun
that Mary Jane and Alice had in the time
that was left before Christmas. They were
about the busiest girls in all Chicago! They
hurried home from school and they worked
Saturdays but, actually, as soon as they got
one thing done they thought of something
else they wanted to make or buy and they
had to begin all over again. They made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
cookies and candies and dressed dolls, one
for each girl, and made a complete set of
covers and pillows and &#8220;fixings&#8221; for an adorable
doll bed that Mr. Merrill made in the
evenings. Alice had to work pretty hard to
get the pajamas all finished in time for there
was considerable work on each pair; but she
got them finished and she could hardly wait
till Christmas to take them over to their family.</p>
<p>Mary Jane finished the muffler and mittens
though she <i>almost</i> had to knit while she
ate&mdash;towards the last&mdash;it takes a good many
stitches to make a muffler big enough for an
eight year old boy. The muffler was a deep
crimson and the mittens a warm shade of
gray with three rows of crimson in the wrist
end; Mary Jane had picked colors she was
sure Tom would like.</p>
<p>At last the twenty-fourth of December
came around&mdash;cold and snowy and just the
kind of a day for making a Christmas. The
trees were bought and set on the balcony, the
turkeys, two of them, were in the pantry
ready to dress and three big baskets were set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
on the dining-room table ready for packing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; said Mrs. Merrill, &#8220;if you
have everything ready, I think we&#8217;d better
pack all the things we can now, because
when Dadah comes home there&#8217;ll be plenty
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane thought the packing was the
most fun of anything she had ever done.
They packed all the doll things in one
basket, doll things and toys and three nice
books. Of course the doll bed wouldn&#8217;t go
in the basket; it had to have a package all by
itself. A second basket was for clothing,
the pajamas&mdash;and no one would ever guess
that a girl as young as Alice had made those
charming garments&mdash;the muffler, the mittens,
one pair for each child, warm underwear
and a dress for each girl (one of the
nicest of Alice and Mary Jane&#8217;s outgrown
frocks). Mr. Merrill had added a nice flannel
shirt for Tom and Mrs. Merrill put in a
warm sweater for the good mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a basket they&#8217;ll like to open,&#8221;
said Alice, proudly, as she tucked the brand
new comforter Mrs. Merrill had made,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
around the top, &#8220;they&#8217;ll be so happy they
won&#8217;t hardly be able to wait till they can
put &#8217;em on!&#8221;</p>
<p>The third basket was fully as interesting
as the others. It was a big, big one and in
it the girls packed groceries, cans of vegetables
and soup and sugar&mdash;a very little bit
to be sure for there wasn&#8217;t much to be had,
but the Merrills had decided to send exactly
half of what they had&mdash;and oranges for
breakfast and cereals and bread. Then on
top, they were to put cookies and candy and
the turkey. But of course those last things
would go in in the morning, just before the
baskets were taken away.</p>
<p>By the time Mr. Merrill came home, the
three baskets were packed, covered up and
set in the corner of the dining-room ready
for morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the tree!&#8221; said Mr. Merrill as
he took off his coat ready for work. He set
their tree in the dining-room and with Alice&#8217;s
good help fixed a solid bottom standard and
set it up in the living-room right in front of
the foolish little fireplace. They wired it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
firmly and then Mrs. Merrill brought in the
boxes of Christmas trimmings and everybody
set to work.</p>
<p>Such fun as it was! Mary Jane kept saying,
&#8220;Remember this!&#8221; And Alice added,
&#8220;Remember that!&#8221; till it seemed as though
it <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> be more than a week since last
Christmas when they had put the same things
on a tree that looked exactly like the one
they were now trimming. This year, seeing
Mary Jane was such a <i>very</i> old person, she
was allowed to put the gold star on the top
of the tree; she climbed the ladder, with
father holding one hand and wired it on all
by herself; and Alice, as a special privilege,
was allowed to hang the crystal icicles on
every tip.</p>
<p>Nobody put any tinsel on the tree&mdash;that
was left for the middle of the night like the
story of the old time legend. Whether the
spiders and the Christmas fairies, working
together, really covered the tree with silver,
Mary Jane never stopped to figure out.
But at any rate the tree was covered with
strings of gold the next morning and Mary
Jane thought it the prettiest Christmas tree
she had ever seen!</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>The very last thing before she went to
bed, Mary Jane hung up her stocking. And
Alice, looking a bit foolish, hung hers close
by.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you two folks weren&#8217;t going to
have any Christmas,&#8221; said Mr. Merrill teasingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;re not,&#8221; said Mary Jane
bravely, &#8220;but we want to hang our stockings
just the same as if&mdash;you know.&#8221; And
Dadah must have understood for he nodded
his head and didn&#8217;t tease any more.</p>
<p>Nobody would say how it ever happened.
Certainly it was well understood that there
were to be no presents. But, anyway, when
Mary Jane and Alice looked at those stockings
Christmas morning they were fat, as
fat could be! Just bulging over with queer
shaped parcels!</p>
<p>Mary Jane couldn&#8217;t even wait to put her
slippers on! She bundled a kimono around
her, grabbed up her stocking and ran into her
mother&#8217;s room to open it. Alice wasn&#8217;t far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
behind and certainly for girls who were to
have <i>no</i> presents, they fared very well indeed!
Santa Claus must have got his signals
mixed some way! There were doll
things for Marie Georgiannamore, and a
ring for Mary Jane; hair ribbons, handkerchiefs,
skates for Alice (think of that in a
stocking!) and slippers for the little girl
who forgot to put on her old pair and, oh,
many lovely little things that could be
tucked into a stocking.</p>
<p>The girls spread the things out on mother&#8217;s
bed and had a happy time till suddenly
Mr. Merrill exclaimed, &#8220;Girls! It&#8217;s eight
o&#8217;clock and I ordered that taxi for nine!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there <i>was</i> a scramble! Gifts were
hustled away, clothes were put on, breakfast
was eaten and a few last things packed in the
baskets, just as the taxi arrived.</p>
<p>It was fortunate Mr. Merrill had ordered a
big car for with three baskets, a bundle containing
the doll bed and another the turkey,
to say nothing of the tree roped on the side
of the car and the box of trimmings on Mrs.
Merrill&#8217;s lap even a big car was pretty full.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Mary Jane felt like a real Santa Claus for
sure!</p>
<p>The family they were going to see didn&#8217;t
know they were coming, so when the car
stopped in front of a shabby little house,
three puzzled and very sober faces pressed
against the window and looked out. But
the sober faces soon changed. In a few minutes
the mother was helping Mrs. Merrill
put the turkey in to roast, the older girl was
helping Mr. Merrill set the Christmas tree
in place and Tom and Ellen, the little girl,
were helping the Merrill girls trim the tree.</p>
<p>When the Merrills left the house some
two hours later the turkey was almost
cooked, the tree was trimmed, presents unpacked
and happiness and good cheer had
settled down in the little house for many a
day.</p>
<p>It was a good thing they came away
when they did, though, for exactly as they
drove up to their own home, they met an
express wagon. And in their own vestibule
they found the driver. &#8220;Family of Merrill
here?&#8221; he asked them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re us,&#8221; said Mary Jane eagerly.
And whereupon the driver carried upstairs
the biggest, fattest Christmas box Mary Jane
had ever seen.</p>
<p>Of course it was from grandma and in it
were so many lovely things from uncles and
grandparents and cousins that Mary Jane
thought she never would get everything unpacked!</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the little girl as some time
later the family sat down to their own belated
dinner, &#8220;I think for not having any
presents, we got a lot! And I think I like
Christmas in Chicago just as much as anywhere,
I do.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A SUMMER HOME&mdash;AND A TELEGRAM</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go skating!&#8221; called Frances one
cold morning as she saw Alice shake
the bath room rug from the balcony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skating?&#8221; answered Alice, &#8220;where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down on the Midway,&#8221; said Frances.
&#8220;As soon as you get your work done, you and
Mary Jane come around to our front door
and Betty and I will be ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mary Jane doesn&#8217;t know how to
skate,&#8221; said Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Betty doesn&#8217;t either,&#8221; answered Frances,
&#8220;but they can take their sleds and coast down
the sides of the bank while you and I skate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice promised and then she hurried inside
to finish her work. She had heard
about the fine skating on the Midway where
the park board flooded the sunken greens
for the benefit of neighborhood children, but
thus far the weather had been too mild for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
any skating, so she hadn&#8217;t had a chance to
try it. But a sudden cold snap, with snow
enough to cover the sloping banks, had provided
both skating and coasting.</p>
<p>Well protected with warm mittens and
leggings the girls set out and had the jolliest
kind of a morning. At one end of the ice,
the younger folks did their coasting, the sloping
sides giving a flying start and the smooth
ice a glorious finish. At the other end the
older boys and girls did their skating, so
there was no mix up or interference.</p>
<p>That morning was the first of many happy
Saturday mornings spent on the ice. Even
Mary Jane got some skates and, with the
help of Dadah when he could get away from
the office, she learned to be a fine skater.</p>
<p>But winter fun never lasts very long.
Just about the time Mary Jane learned to
skate well enough to challenge Alice to a
race, the spring sun sent the ice to nowhere
land and the while-ago ice pond turned to
green grass! Spring had come.</p>
<p>With the coming of spring, Mary Jane
grew very restless. She wasn&#8217;t sick, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
something was wrong. Something was
making her very solemn and sober&mdash;quite
unlike her usual lively self.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what&#8217;s the matter with me,&#8221; she
announced one warm sunny morning, &#8220;I
want to dig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to dig?&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Merrill
in amazement, &#8220;well, why don&#8217;t you go
down and dig in the Holdens&#8217; yard? You
know Mrs. Holden said you might.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to dig in somebody&#8217;s
yard,&#8221; answered Mary Jane, without a spark
of interest, &#8220;I want to dig in my <i>own</i> yard
and have flowers and a sand pile and everything
right in my own yard, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Merrill didn&#8217;t reply but she did do a
lot of thinking and that evening she and
Mr. Merrill had a long conference.</p>
<p>As a result, at breakfast table the next
morning Mr. Merrill said, &#8220;How would you
girls like to have a summer home of your
own? A place in the woods where we could
go as soon as school closes and where you
could wear bloomers and play in the sand
and gather flowers and make garden and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
the things you love to do but can&#8217;t do in
the city. How would you like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jane and Alice stared at him.
Would they <i>like</i> it? anybody could see by
their faces that they would <i>love</i> it!</p>
<p>&#8220;But we wouldn&#8217;t want to leave you here
in Chicago, all summer,&#8221; objected Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I wouldn&#8217;t want to be left,&#8221; Mr.
Merrill assured them. &#8220;But I am sure,
somewhere in the suburbs around Chicago
there must be <i>some place</i> we could get a summer
home. And we&#8217;ll make it our business
to find that place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; began Mrs. Merrill, and then
she hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something nice?&#8221; asked Alice, encouragingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been nice,&#8221; admitted Mrs.
Merrill, &#8220;but likely we couldn&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;d
been thinking how pleasant it would be to
take another trip this summer. You know
how you girls enjoyed going to Florida.
And you remember Uncle Hal graduates
from Harvard this June. I had been wondering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
if we could go east in time to be there
when the festivities are going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; cried Mary Jane, &#8220;what
fun! I do want to ride on a train, a big
train with a sleeper and a diner! But then
I want to dig, too,&#8221; she added, insistently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll take one thing at a time,&#8221;
suggested Mr. Merrill. &#8220;We&#8217;ll look into
the question of a summer home&mdash;we know
we&#8217;d all like that. And you folks don&#8217;t
know that a very popular uncle would <i>want</i>
a grown up sister and two small nieces hanging
around at commencement time,&#8221; he
added teasingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you find a summer home?&#8221; asked
Alice thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll have to discover,&#8221;
laughed Mr. Merrill. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll begin
this very Saturday afternoon if the weather
is fine. We&#8217;ll take a suburban train and
ride till we see a place that looks homey and
there we&#8217;ll get off and hunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next Saturday was warm and sunny,
the kind of a day for bringing flowers into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
bloom and for making little girls want to
play out of doors. Mrs. Merrill and the
girls met Mr. Merrill at his office so as not
to lose a minute&#8217;s time, and they hurried
right over to the station, and got aboard the
first suburban train they could find.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is lots of fun,&#8221; said Mary
Jane as they found their seats, &#8220;we don&#8217;t
know where we&#8217;re going&mdash;we&#8217;re just going!&#8221;
And the train was off.</p>
<p>For some time the girls were really discouraged.
They passed factories, and tenements,
and more factories till Mary Jane was
sure they were never coming to country&mdash;real
country. But suddenly, when she was
about to give up, the factories were gone and
from the window the girls could see wide
fields and strips of woods and an occasional
brook. Two or three little stations were
passed and then the train ran through a
beautiful stretch of woods&mdash;rolling woods
all leafy and budding and flower decked.
The ground was fairly covered with early
blossoms and trees of wild crab were just
bursting into pink bloom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>Mary Jane grabbed her coat and started
down the aisle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make &#8217;em stop the train, Dadah,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;this is where we want to live!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately at that minute the train really
did stop at a small station and the Merrills
got off and looked around. It didn&#8217;t take
long to explore into the woods far enough to
find that they had come to the very place
they were looking for&mdash;a spot not too far
from the city for Mr. Merrill&#8217;s daily trip and
yet wild enough to give the girls some real
woods. The girls picked flowers as they explored
and had such a happy time that it was
hard work to persuade them to go back to the
city when the twilight came. But they had
found the very place!</p>
<p>Three weeks later Mr. Merrill bought a
lot in the heart of the woods, and the summer
home was no longer a mere dream&mdash;it
was to be really truly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; announced Alice, &#8220;we&#8217;ll draw
the kind of a house we want. I love to draw
plans of a house!&#8221; She cleared off the dining
table, sharpened pencils, brought two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
tablets and insisted that everybody come out
and help.</p>
<p>And just then the door bell rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telegram for Merrill!&#8221; shouted a voice
through the tube and Mary Jane pressed the
buzzer in a hurry&mdash;a telegram usually meant
something exciting.</p>
<p>It was addressed to Mrs. Merrill and said,
&#8220;Have all tickets and hotel reservations.
You and the girls must come.&#8221; And it was
signed by Mrs. Merrill&#8217;s brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that isn&#8217;t just like a college boy!&#8221;
laughed Mrs. Merrill. &#8220;For weeks he
doesn&#8217;t answer a letter and then he telegraphs!
Girls,&#8221; she added, &#8220;let&#8217;s go!
Wouldn&#8217;t you like to go to Boston and see
the college and the ocean and the White
Mountains&mdash;and&mdash;everything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, <i>really</i>?&#8221; exclaimed Mary
Jane. (She felt as though she must be
dreaming, things were happening so fast!)</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about the summer home?&#8221;
asked Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about the summer
home,&#8221; Mr. Merrill assured her, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
that summer home just the same. You girls
take your trip east. You won&#8217;t be gone
more than a couple of weeks&mdash;and what are
two weeks out of a whole summer? And
before you go, we&#8217;ll get the shack all planned
and when you come back we&#8217;ll move out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goody! Goody! Goody!&#8221; cried Mary
Jane happily, &#8220;then I can see Uncle Hal
and ride on the train and dig a garden and
<i>everything</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>And if you want to hear all about Mary
Jane&#8217;s beautiful trip to Boston and the
White Mountains, the fun she had sight-seeing
and the jolly party on &#8220;Class Day,&#8221;

<p>Mary Jane is the typical American little
girl who bubbles over with fun and the
good things in life. We meet her here on
a visit to her grandfather&#8217;s farm where she
becomes acquainted with farm life and farm

<p>Chicken Little Jane is a
Western prairie girl who

good times she has!&mdash;with
her pets, her friends, and
her many interests.
&#8220;Chicken Little&#8221; is the affectionate
nickname given to her when she is

<p>Children, meet Sunny
Boy, a little fellow with
big eyes and an inquiring
disposition, who finds the
world a large and wonderful
thing indeed. And
somehow there is lots going
on, when Sunny Boy
is around. Perhaps he
helps push! In the first
book of this new series he
has the finest time ever,
with his Grandpa out in
the country. He learns a
lot and he helps a lot, in his small way. Then
he has a glorious visit to the seashore, but this is
in the next story. And there are still more adventures
in the third book and fourth book. You
will like Sunny Boy.</p>

<p>In all nursery literature animals have
played a conspicuous part; and the reason
is obvious, for nothing entertains a child
more than the antics of an animal. These
stories abound in amusing incidents such
as children adore, and the characters are
so full of life, so appealing to a child&#8217;s
imagination, that none will be satisfied until
they have met all of their favorites&mdash;Squinty,
Slicko, Mappo, and the rest.</p>

<p>When Yank Brown comes
to Belmont College as a
callow Freshman, there is
a whole lot that he doesn&#8217;t
know about college life,
such as class rushes, rivalries,
fraternities, and what
a lowly Freshman must
not do. But he does know
something about how to
play football, and he is a
big, likeable chap who
speedily makes friends.</p>
<p>In the first story of this
series we watch Yank buck the line as a Halfback.
In the second story he goes in for basketball,
among many other activities of a busy college
year. Then there are other stories to follow&mdash;each
brimful of action and interest. This
is one of the best college series we have seen in
a long while.</p>
